  3'-dA Phosphoramidate NUC-7738:
    Code: C171381
    Definition: A phosphoramidate derivative of the monophosphate form of cordycepin
      (3\'-deoxyadenosine; 3\'-dA), an adenosine derivative first isolated from Cordyceps
      sinensis, with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory
      activities. Upon administration and cellular uptake of NUC-7738 by passive diffusion,
      cordycepin monophosphate (3\'-dAMP) is converted into its active anti-cancer
      metabolite 3\'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3\'-dATP). 3\'-dATP functions as
      a ribonucleoside analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore,
      this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation,
      and induces apoptosis. Also, 3\'-dAMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This prevents
      the hyperphosphorylation of the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1. This results
      in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation.
      mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
      signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression
      or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Compared to cordycepin
      alone, the addition of the phosphoramidate moiety may overcome cancer resistance
      and allow for greater cytotoxicity as NUC-7738 does not require a nucleoside
      transporter for cellular uptake, is independent of  enzymatic activation by
      adenosine kinase (AK) and is not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by adenosine
      deaminase (ADA). Altogether, this may help overcome cancer resistance to cordycepin.

    Definition: A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma
      is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries
      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the
      term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic
      syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required
      for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination
      of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently,
      according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best
      classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following
      myelodysplastic syndrome).  A minority of cases are part of RAEB-2.

      of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR; ADORA2A), with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, A2AR antagonist EOS100850
      selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents
      tumor-released adenosine from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking
      the adenosine/A2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the
      proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated
      immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is
      highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine,
      inhibits their proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often overproduced
      by cancer cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression.

  Adenosine A2A Receptor Antagonist CS3005:
    Code: C175468
    Definition: An orally bioavailable immune checkpoint inhibitor and antagonist
      of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR; ADORA2A), with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, A2AR antagonist CS3005 selectively
      binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents tumor-released
      adenosine from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking the adenosine/A2AR-mediated
      inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation
      of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor
      cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces
      of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and
      activation. Adenosine is often overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key
      role in immunosuppression.

  Adenovirus 5/F35-Human Guanylyl Cyclase C-PADRE:
    Code: C173640
    Definition: A recombinant adenoviral serotype 5 (Ad5) in which the Ad5-based vector
      fiber is replaced by the fiber from the human B adenovirus serotype 35 (F35),
      encoding for the human guanylyl cyclase C (hGCC), and fused to the synthetic
      Pan DR epitope (PADRE), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities.
      Upon intramuscular administration of the Ad5/F35-hGCC-PADRE, the Ad5/F35 targets
      CD46, which is expressed widely on most tumor cells, and the virus is taken
      up by cells. Once inside the cells, the virus expresses hGCC. The expressed
      hGCC induces both humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells
      expressing the hGCC antigen. This results in the immune-mediated killing of
      tumor cells. The hGCC protein is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial
      cells but is overexpressed by metastatic colorectal tumors. PADRE is a helper
      T-lymphocyte epitope that is able to augment the magnitude and duration of the
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. The inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/F35
      fiber increases viral uptake in cells through CD46.

  Allogeneic Anti-BCMA CAR-transduced T-cells ALLO-715:
    Code: C165779
    Definition: A preparation of allogeneic, \'off-the-shelf\' (OTS), universal transcription
      activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-engineered, gene-edited T-lymphocytes
      that have been transduced with a vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) containing a single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal
      antibody specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) B-cell maturation
      antigen (BCMA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17; TNFRSF17),
      with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Using TALEN
      technology, the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain (TRAC) and CD52 genes are
      deleted from the CAR T-cells. Upon administration, the allogeneic anti-BCMA
      CAR-transduced T-cells ALLO-715 specifically recognize and induce selective
      toxicity in BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing
      ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). BCMA is found on the surfaces
      of plasma cells, is overexpressed on malignant plasma cells and plays a key
      role in plasma cell proliferation and survival. Deletion of the CD52 gene makes
      the modified donor T-cells resistant to an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody treatment,
      that is used during lymphodepletion. The knockout of TRAC eliminates TCR expression
      and is intended to abrogate the potential induction of graft-versus-host disease
      (GvHD) by the donor T-cells. The donor-derived, gene-edited CAR T cells have
      reduced production times and have increased availability when compared to autologous
      CAR-T cells, which use the patient\'s own cells and are produced on an individual
      basis. In addition, if the ALLO-715 cells cause unacceptable side effects, the
      incorporated CD20-based off-switch permits selective depletion of the ALLO-715
      cells when the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is administered.

      bispecific CAR-T cells target and bind to tumor cells expressing BCMA and/or
      CS1 and induce selective cytotoxicity in those cells. BCMA, a receptor for both
      a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF),

      tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) and intracellular adaptor proteins. SLAMF7
      is highly expressed on certain malignant plasma cells and is minimally expressed
      on healthy immune cells. Targeting the two different TAAs highly expressed on
      malignant plasma cells may improve coverage and protect against antigen escape

    Definition: The anhydrous form of enol-oxaloacetate, a small molecule blood glutamate
      scavenger, that can be used to lower glutamate plasma levels, and has potential
      neuroprotective activity. Upon administration, enol-oxaloacetate targets and
      binds to glutamate in the bloodstream. This lowers glutamate plasma levels and
      lowers the free glutamate available to be picked up by cells, such as tumor
      brain cells, thereby preventing glutamate metabolism and glutamate-mediated
      signaling. This prevents the proliferation of rapidly growing cells, such as
      brain tumor cells. And by lowering glutamate plasma levels, a molecular imbalance
      is formed and glutamate is excreted across the blood-brain barrier, resulting
      in lower free brain glutamate.  This may help protect the brain from excitotoxicity
      in conditions where there is a surge of glutamate production, such as traumatic
      brain injury, thereby protecting neuronal cells. Glutamate, a non-essential
      amino acid and the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
      system (CNS), provides energy and generates building blocks for the production
      of macromolecules, which are needed for cellular growth and survival.

  Anti-BCMA SparX Protein Plus BCMA-directed Anti-TAAG ARC T-cells CART-ddBCMA:
    Code: C167337
    Definition: An immunotherapeutic combination agent composed of antigen receptor
      complex T cells (ARC-T cells) which contain a proprietary binding domain specific
      for a universal TAG instead of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding
      domain, and a tumor-targeting antigen protein, soluble protein antigen-receptor
      X-linker (sparX) protein, containing a TAG moiety fused to two B-cell maturation
      antigen (BCMA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17; TNFRSF17)
      binding domains, with potential antineoplastic activities. Upon administration
      of the anti-BCMA sparX protein plus BCMA-directed ARC T-cells CART-ddBCMA, the
      sparX protein, with its two BCMA binding domains, specifically targets and binds
      to two BCMA expressed on tumor cells. In turn, the ARC-T cells, with their anti-TAG
      domain, target and bind to the TAG domain on the sparX protein. This directly
      links the ARC-T cells to the BCMA-expressing tumor cells, through the ARC-T
      cell- sparX -tumor cell complex formation, thereby causing direct tumor cell
      killing. BCMA, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is found on the surfaces of
      plasma cells and is overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types. Compared
      to anti-BCMA CAR-T cells, CART-ddBCMA, containing ARC-T cells that are re-programmed
      in vivo by the TAG sparX protein, shows enhanced efficiency and an improved
      safety profile. As ARC-T activity is dependent on the sparX dose administered,
      the rate of tumor cell killing, and related toxicities are also dependent on
      the sparX dose administered.

      anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody JSP191 targets and binds to CD117. This prevents
      the binding of stem cell factor (SCF) to its receptor CD117 on HSCs.  As CD117
      binding to SCF is critical for survival and maintenance of blood forming stem
      cells, blocking this interaction causes the HSCs that are present in the bone
      marrow niches to be depleted. JSP191 can potentially be used as a conditioning

      necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9), with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD137 agonistic monoclonal
      antibody AGEN2373 targets and binds to a non-ligand blocking epitope on CD137,
      thereby activating CD137 expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including
      activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This enhances CD137-mediated
      signaling, induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, cytokine production
      and promotes a CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response as well as induces NK-mediated
      tumor cell killing and suppresses the immunosuppressive activity of T-regulatory

      anti-CD19 antibody T-cell receptor (AbTCR) structure (ET190L1), with potential
      immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD19
      AbTCR-expressing T-cells ET019003 targets and binds to CD19-expressing tumor
      cells. This results in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated elimination of
      CD19-positive tumor cells. The binding to CD19-expressing tumor cells may also
      activate the undisclosed costimulatory domain, leading to further T-cell proliferation.
      CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen overexpressed in B-cell
      lineage malignancies. ET019003 is able to match the anticancer activity of chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, while they are less likely to stimulate cytokine
      release syndrome (CRS) and less likely to cause cytokine-related toxicities.

    Definition: A preparation of natural killer (NK) cells engineered to express an
      inhibitory chimeric antigen receptor (iCAR) specific for the tumor-associated
      antigen (TAA) cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD19 iCAR-NK cells
      recognize, bind to and induce selective cytotoxicity in CD19-expressing tumor
      cells. The iCAR is designed to spare normal cells from NK cell actions by including
      an inhibitory receptor that is activated upon binding to antigens that are present
      on normal cells only. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen
      expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies.

      cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) and CD22, with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the anti-CD19/CD22 CAR-NK
      cells target and bind to CD19 and CD22 expressed on the surface of tumor cells.
      This induces selective toxicity in tumor cells expressing these TAAs. CD19 and
      CD22, both transmembrane phosphoglycoproteins expressed on the surface of cells
      in the B lineage, are often overexpressed on malignant B-cells. By simultaneously
      targeting two B-cell antigens, this preparation may minimize relapse due to
      single antigen loss in patients with B-cell malignancies.

      monoclonal antibody BAT4306F, the antibody specifically targets and binds to
      CD20. This induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against
      CD20-expressing B-cells, which leads to B-cell apoptosis and the inhibition
      of tumor cell proliferation. CD20, a non-glycosylated cell surface phosphoprotein
      that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development,
      is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. The complete defucosylation of

      This induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD20-expressing
      B-cells, which leads to B-cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
      In addition, MIL62 inhibits CD20-mediated signaling which further induces apoptosis
      in and inhibits proliferation of CD20-expressing tumor cells. CD20, a non-glycosylated

      antigen 75; Ly75) humanized immunoglobin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody conjugated
      to DM4, a maytansinoid microtubule disruptor, via a cleavable N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridyldithio)
      butanoate (SPDB) linker, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous
      administration, anti-CD205 ADC OBT076 specifically targets and binds to CD205,
      a receptor involved in antigen capture and endocytosis, expressed on tumor cells.
      Following rapid internalization of the ADC/CD205 complex, OBT076 releases its
      DM4 payload due to cleavage of the SPDB linker by intracellular proteases. Then
      the DM4 binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics,
      resulting in the inhibition of both cell division and cell growth of CD205-expressing
      tumor cells. CD205, a type I transmembrane surface glycoprotein belonging to
      the C-type lectin receptor family, is normally expressed on various antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs) and some leukocyte sub-populations but it is overexpressed in multiple
      cancer types where it plays a key role in facilitating metastatic invasion.

      moiety of anti-CD228/MMAE ADC SGN-CD228A targets and binds to CD228 on the surface
      of tumor cells. Following internalization of SGN-CD228A and release of MMAE,
      MMAE targets and binds to tubulin, and inhibits microtubule polymerization.
      This results in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CD228-expressing

      T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CD27, a co-stimulatory
      molecule and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF),
      is expressed on T-lymphocytes, memory B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells.
      It plays an important role in NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity and T- and

      (ADCs), one containing a monoclonal antibody against CD3 and one against the
      CD7 antigen on activated T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and both conjugated
      to ricin toxin A (RTA), the A-chain form of the potent plant toxin ricin, that
      can potentially be used to destroy activated T- and NK cells. Upon administration
      of the anti-CD3/CD7-RTA immunotoxin, the anti-CD3 antibody moiety targets and
      binds to activated T-cells; the anti-CD7 antibody moiety targets and binds to
      CD7 on activated T-cells and NK cells. Upon internalization and cleavage, the
      RTA moiety irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis and induces apoptosis in
      the activated T-cells. This may eliminate activated T-cells and may improve
      conditions such as graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). In addition, the binding
      and blocking of the anti-CD3 antibody to the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex (TCR/CD3)
      results in activation-induced cell death (AICD) and immunosuppression.

      immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that targets two separate epitopes
      on the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD37, with the E430G hexamerization-enhancing
      mutation, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, the anti-CD37 bispecific monoclonal antibody GEN3009 specifically
      targets and binds to two non-overlapping CD37 epitopes, thereby inducing an
      assembly of antibody hexamers through intermolecular Fc-Fc interactions at the
      cell surface of CD37-overexpressing tumor cells. These hexamers recruit and
      activate C1, the first component of complement, thereby triggering the complement
      cascade which activates the immune system to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity
      (CDC). In addition, GEN3009 binding to the CD37-overexpressing tumor cells also
      causes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent
      cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily
      of cell surface antigens, is expressed at high-levels on B cells and to a lesser
      extent on T cells and myeloid cells. The E430G mutation in the Fc domains enhances
      Fc-mediated IgG hexamerization upon cellular target binding, and enhances CDC.

      receptor CD39 (cluster of differentiation 39; ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1;
      NTPDase1; ENTPD1), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, anti-CD39 monoclonal antibody SRF617 specifically binds
      to the CD39 antigen, thereby preventing the conversion and degradation of adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This leads to an increase
      in the extracellular levels of immunogenic ATP and a decrease in the levels
      of immunosuppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment (TME). A high
      level of ATP increases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and promotes both T-cell
      proliferation and the stimulation of dendritic and other myeloid-derived cells
      that are necessary for innate and adaptive immunity. CD39, a cell surface ectonucleosidase,
      is upregulated on tumor cells as an immune evasion strategy. Blocking its action
      may improve anti-tumor immune responses.

      antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, anti-CD40/anti-4-1BB bispecific
      agonist monoclonal antibody GEN1042 simultaneously binds to CD40 and 4-1BB,
      crosslinks CD40 and 4-1BB positive cells, induces conditional stimulation, and
      activates both CD40- and 4-1BB-medicated signaling. The activation of CD40-mediated
      signaling triggers the proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting cells
      (APCs) and activates T-cells. This results in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. The activation of 4-1BB-mediated
      signaling induces cytokine production and promotes T-cell mediated anti-tumor
      immune responses. CD40, a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis
      factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on various immune cells,
      such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and B-cells, and plays a key role
      in the activation of the immune system. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the

      and binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells, blocking the interaction of CD47
      with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) expressed on phagocytic cells.
      This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated
      inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis of cancer cells. This induces
      pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which
      is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), which is expressed on macrophages,

      and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing cancer cells to
      proliferate. IMC-002 does not bind to red blood cells (RBCs). This may prevent

      Upon administration of anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody TG-1801,
      the anti-CD19 moiety selectively targets and binds to CD19 on CD19-positive
      B-cells, thereby improving binding of the anti-CD47 moiety to the CD19+ malignant
      B-cells. The CD47 binding by TG-1801 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal
      regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages
      and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling
      and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces
      pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which
      is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results

      with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects
      cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. CD19
      is a membrane antigen that is widely expressed during B-cell development and
      in B-cell malignancies. By co-targeting CD47 and CD19, TG-1801 has the potential
      to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly
      avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSCs) which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis.

      directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody
      ONC-392 targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated
      downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer
      cells. As ONC-392 is dissociated from CTLA-4 under low pH, it does not cause
      lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4, preserving CTLA-4 and allowing the recycling
      of CTLA-4. This may result in more efficient and selective CTLA-4-targeted regulatory
      T-cell (Treg) depletion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving
      CTLA-4 functions outside the TME, thereby reducing toxicities. CTLA-4, an inhibitory
      receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role
      in the downregulation of the immune system.

  Anti-CTLA-4 Probody BMS-986288:
    Code: C173435
    Definition: A probody composed of a modified version of ipilimumab, a recombinant
      human monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), linked to a proprietary masking
      peptide that covers the active antigen-binding site of the antibody through
      a protease-cleavable linker, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and
      antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 probody BMS-986288,
      the masking peptide is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases upon extravasation
      into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Protease-mediated removal of the linker
      enables binding of the unmasked monoclonal antibody moiety to CTLA-4, which
      is expressed on certain T-cells. This inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation
      of T-cell activation, and leads to both activation of tumor infiltrating T-effector
      cells and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer
      cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
      expressed on activated effector T-cells (Teffs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs),
      plays a key role in the inhibition of T-cell activity and downregulation of
      the immune system. The peptide masking of BMS-986288 minimizes binding to CTLA-4
      in normal tissues and may reduce systemic toxicity, when compared to ipilimumab.
      Tumor-associated proteases are present in high concentrations and aberrantly
      activated in the TME.

      anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody combination BCD-217 targets and binds
      to both PD-1 and CTLA-4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and
      inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and
      proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are
      selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively
      regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles
      in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity.
      Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation and proliferation
      more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.

      targets and binds to the CD16A expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages,
      and to EGFR on EGFR-expressing tumor cells, thereby selectively cross-linking
      EGFR-expressing tumor cells with NK cells and macrophages. This may result in
      NK cell and macrophage activation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
      (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and eventually tumor
      cell lysis. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase upregulated or mutated in many

      Upon administration of MORAb-202, the farletuzumab moiety targets and binds
      to FRA expressed on certain tumor cells. Upon binding, internalization, and
      enzymatic cleavage, eribulin binds to the vinca domain of tubulin and inhibits
      the polymerization of tubulin and the assembly of microtubules, resulting in
      inhibition of mitotic spindle assembly, induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M
      phase, and the induction of tumor cell death in FRA-expressing cells. FRA is

      antibody-IL-21 mutein fusion protein AMG 256, the antibody moiety specifically
      targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This
      may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated

      antibody IBI318 simultaneously targets and binds to PD-1, which is expressed
      on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), and PD-L1, which is expressed on tumor cells. This crosslinks

  Anti-PD-1/CD47 Infusion Protein HX009:
    Code: C168600
    Definition: A bispecific antibody fusion protein directed against the human negative
      immunoregulatory checkpoint receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1;
      PDCD1; CD279) and the human cell surface antigen CD47, with potential immunostimulating,
      phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of
      anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively
      targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells.
      The CD47 binding by HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory
      protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and
      dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and
      abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces
      pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which
      is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results
      in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing
      tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1
      and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents
      the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore
      effector T-cell functions and may further activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      tumor cell killing. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is
      a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells,
      such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a
      variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha,
      leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from
      phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47
      and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted
      therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on
      healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated
      phagocytosis. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily
      (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint
      that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated
      by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

      PDCD1; CD279) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4),
      with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, anti-PD1/CTLA4 bispecific antibody MEDI5752 targets and binds
      to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs),
      and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation
      and proliferation. In addition, MEDI5752 is internalized and is able to degrade
      PD-1. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are
      selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively
      regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles
      in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity.
      Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with MEDI5752 may enhance T-cell activation
      and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor
      alone. It may also decrease toxicity by avoiding the binding to CTLA-4-expressing
      T-cells that are devoid of PD-1. The engineered Fc domain may reduce Fc effector
      function.

      inhibitory, anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration
      of anti-PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody AK112, this agent simultaneously targets
      and binds to both PD-1 expressed on certain T-cells and VEGF. The binding of
      AK112 to PD-1 prevents the activation of PD-1 by its ligands, programmed cell
      death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and/or 2 (PD-L2). This abrogates T-cell inhibition,
      activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth.
      The binding of AK112 to VEGF prevents binding of VEGF to its receptor VEGFR,
      abrogates VEGF/VEGFR-mediated signaling and may lead to the inhibition of vascular
      endothelial cell proliferation. The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may further
      decrease tumor cell proliferation and prevent metastasis. PD-1, a transmembrane

      same time,GEN1046 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor,
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates
      T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic
      T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth.
      PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival
      of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune
      evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
      superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in
      T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.

  Anti-PD-L1/IL-15 Fusion Protein KD033:
    Code: C173592
    Definition: A fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody directed against
      the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster
      of differentiation 274; CD274) fused to the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-15
      (IL-15), with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration of the anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein KD033, the anti-PD-L1
      antibody moiety specifically targets and binds to PD-L1 expressing cells in
      the tumor microenvironment (TME). In turn, IL-15 stimulates the proliferation
      of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells
      locally in the TME, which induces an anti-tumor immune response. This may increase
      tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. IL-15 regulates CD8+
      T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. PD-L1, a transmembrane
      protein, is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and
      on many cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a negative regulator of the
      immune system on activated T-cells, limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive
      T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.

      single-chain variable fragment (scFv), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration of IMC-F106C, the TCR moiety of this agent targets and binds
      to PRAME on tumor cells and the anti-CD3 scFv moiety binds to CD3- expressing
      T-lymphocytes. This selectively cross-links tumor cells and T-lymphocytes and
      results in a CTL-mediated death of PRAME-expressing tumor cells. The TAA PRAME

      Upon administration of anti-PSMA/CD3 bispecific antibody CCW702, this bispecific
      antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and PSMA found
      on PSMA-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to PSMA-expressing
      tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of PSMA-expressing
      tumor cells. PSMA is overexpressed on the surface of metastatic and hormone-refractory
      prostate cancer cells.

      on osteoclast cell surfaces. This results in the inhibition of osteoclast activity,
      a decrease in bone resorption, and a potential increase in bone mineral density.
      By blocking the activation of the RANK/RANKL-mediated signaling pathway, GB-223
      may also reduce tumor-associated bone destruction and may result in tumor regression
      in bone tumors with high RANK and RANKL expressions. RANKL, a protein expressed
      by osteoblastic cells, plays an important role in osteoclastic differentiation

      orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) site-specifically conjugated to a derivative of the
      highly potent anthracycline PNU-159682, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon intravenous administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of NBE-002 targets
      and binds to ROR1 expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization,
      the anthracycline-based toxin intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase
      II. This leads to an inhibition of DNA replication and repair, and prevents
      RNA and protein synthesis. This kills the ROR1-expressing cancer cells. In addition,
      the PNU-159682 derivate may promote immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activate
      a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response, thereby
      further killing the ROR1-expressing tumor cells. ROR1, also known as neurotrophic
      tyrosine kinase, receptor-related 1 (NTRKR1), is expressed during embryogenesis
      and by certain leukemias. It plays key roles in tumor cell proliferation and

  Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Inhibitor IK-175:
    Code: C171151
    Definition: An orally bioavailable selective inhibitor of the aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor (AhR; class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 76; bHLHe76), with potential
      immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, AhR
      inhibitor IK-175 specifically targets and binds to AhR, inhibits AhR activation,
      prevents AhR-mediated signaling, and AhR-dependent tumor cell proliferation.
      Abrogation of AhR activation prevents the activation of immune-tolerant dendritic
      cells (DCs), regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and decreases suppressive cytokines
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It stimulates cytotoxic T-cell activation
      and expansion. This may restore the immune response against tumor cells. AhR,
      a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription
      factors, plays key roles in regulating immunity and cellular differentiation.

    Definition: A small molecule pro-drug consisting of cytarabine, an antimetabolite
      analog of cytidine with a modified arabinose sugar moiety, covalently bonded
      to asparagine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration,
      aspacytarabine targets cancer cells, which often lack asparagine synthetase
      and are dependent on an external source of amino acids due to their high metabolic
      rate. Once the prodrug is inside target cells, the cytarabine component is cleaved
      and competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA. The arabinose sugar moiety
      of cytarabine sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, resulting
      in cell cycle arrest, specifically during the S phase of replication. Cytarabine
      also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and
      repair. Because BST-236 specifically targets cancer cells, it may spare normal

      Upon intra-tumoral injection, TMV-018 preferentially enters and transfects tumor
      cells, and expresses SCD, an enzyme that catalyzes the intracellular conversion
      of the prodrug flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine; 5-FC) into the antineoplastic
      agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). After administration of 5-FC, the tumor can be
      eradicated upon activation of 5-FU by SCD. In addition, the oncolytic MV may
      infect and lyse tumor cells. In turn, the lysed tumor cells release various
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which induce an immune response against the
      tumor cells. This may further eradicate tumor cells.

      CD19-expressing tumor cells and cell lysis of these cells. The binding of the
      PD1/CD28 chimera to PD-L1 prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression
      and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the
      stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This enhances T-lymphocyte proliferation and anti-tumor
      activity. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen overexpressed
      in B-cell lineage malignancies. PD-1 protein, found on activated T-cells, negatively
      regulates T-cell activity. It plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents
      tumor cell lysis. The construct of the PD1/CD28 chimera converts PD-L1 into
      a co-stimulation ligand of primary human CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).
      CD28 is a costimulatory molecule expressed by T-cells that enhances T-lymphocyte
      proliferation and activity.

      killing of CD19-positive tumor cells. Disrupting the expression of HPK1 may
      enhance immune response and autoimmunity. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific
      cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. HPK1 is a
      Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase that suppresses immune responses and autoimmunity.

      receptor (CAR) encoding human natural-killer group 2, member D receptor protein
      (NKG2D or KLRK1) with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MHC class I chain-related
      protein A (MICA) and MICB, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon infusion back into the patient, autologous NKG2D CAR T-cells
      CYAD-02 specifically recognize and bind to tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligands,
      resulting in the lysis of NKG2D ligand-expressing tumor cells. In addition,
      CYAD-02 targets, binds to and kills NKG2D ligand expressing tumor-associated
      endothelial cells in the neovasculature and immunosuppressive cells, such as
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the
      tumor microenvironment (TME) that express NKG2D ligands. It also activates macrophages
      within the TME. Ligands for NKG2D, such as MICA, MICB, and members of the UL16-binding
      proteins (ULBP)/retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAET1) family, are overexpressed
      on infected cells and most cancer cell types, but are not expressed on most
      normal, healthy cells. NKG2D, a dimeric, type II transmembrane protein expressed
      on human natural killer (NK) and certain T-cells, in association with the natural
      adaptive protein DAP10, promotes the elimination of NKG2D ligand-expressing
      cells. The shRNA downregulates the expression of MICA and MICB on the CAR-T
      cells, which increases in-vitro cell expansion. This may enhance their persistence
      and increase anti-tumor activity.

      an inducible expression cassette encoding transgenic interleukin (IL) 7 (IL-7)
      or 12 (IL-12), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon intratumoral administration, the autologous nectin-4/FAP-targeted CAR-T
      cells target and bind to nectin-4-expressing tumor cells and FAP-expressing
      cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This results in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte

      leading to cell lysis of these cells. Upon the binding to nectin-4 and FAP and
      the activation of the CAR-T cells, cytokine IL-7 or IL-12 is also released.
      This further augments the immune responses against the tumor cells, which may
      include the attack of nectin-4-negative tumor cells by tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNFa). Nectin-4, a TAA belonging to the nectin family, is overexpressed
      in a variety of cancers, including breast, bladder, lung and pancreatic cancer.

      units of CARs, one specific for the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) B-cell maturation
      antigen (BCMA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17; TNFRSF17)
      and one specific for the TAA CD19, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, the BCMA-CD19 cCAR T cells specifically and
      simultaneously target and bind to tumor cells expressing BCMA and/or CD19. This
      induces selective toxicity in tumor cells that express BCMA and/or CD19. BCMA,
      a tumor-specific antigen and a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand
      (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis
      factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and plays a key role in the survival of

      mutations of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (B-raf) protein, including
      V600 BRAF mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations, and RAF fusions, with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, BRAF inhibitor BGB-3245 targets
      and binds to both monomeric and dimeric forms of activating BRAF mutations and
      fusions. This may result in the inhibition of BRAF-mediated signaling and inhibit
      proliferation in tumor cells expressing BRAF mutations and fusions. BRAF belongs
      to the RAF family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays a role in regulating
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers
      and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. BRAF mutations

      activity. Upon oral administration, BRAF(V600E) kinase inhibitor ABM-1310 selectively
      binds to and inhibits the activity of BRAF(V600E) kinase, which may result in
      the inhibition of an over-activated MAPK signaling pathway downstream in BRAF(V600E)
      kinase-expressing tumor cells and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. BRAF
      belongs to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays
      a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway. The valine to glutamic
      acid substitution at residue 600 accounts for about 90% of BRAF gene mutations.
      The oncogenic product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity
      that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway. The BRAF(V600E) mutation has
      been found to occur in about 8% of all tumors.

  Basal cell epithelioma:
    Code: C2921
    Definition: 'The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells
      of the epidermis and pilosebaceous units. Clinically it is divided into the
      following types: nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous,
      and sclerosing or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients
      over 40. They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas.
      Approximately 85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the
      trunk and extremities. Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent
      fashion. However, if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal
      muscle and bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation
      cure most basal cell carcinomas.'

    Definition: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of belantamab, an afucosylated,
      humanized monoclonal antibody, directed against the B-cell maturation antigen
      (BCMA), conjugated to mafodotin, an auristatin analogue and microtubule inhibitor
      monomethyl auristatin phenylalanine (MMAF), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration of belantamab mafodotin, the anti-BCMA antibody moiety selectively
      binds to BCMA on tumor cell surfaces. Upon internalization, the MMAF moiety
      binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, which results in G2/M phase
      arrest and induces tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, belantamab mafodotin induces
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in
      the inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress BCMA.
      BCMA, a receptor for a proliferation-inducing ligand and B-cell activating factor,
      is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and plays
      a key role in plasma cell survival; it is found on the surfaces of plasma cells

      belvarafenib binds to and inhibits the B-Raf mutant V600E and C-Raf. This inhibits
      B-Raf V600E- and C-Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, thereby inhibiting
      tumor cell growth of susceptible tumor cells. In addition, belvarafenib may
      also inhibit mutated Ras proteins. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the
      Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related
      kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers
      and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The Raf mutation
      B-Raf V600E, where the valine at residue 600 is substituted for glutamic acid,
      is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and results in the
      constitutive activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

  Bomedemstat:
    Code: C131827
    Definition: An orally available, irreversible inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase
      1 (LSD1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, bomedemstat
      binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression of
      target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at position
      4 of histone H3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4. LSD1 inhibition enhances
      H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes. In
      addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9 which increases gene
      expression of tumor promoting genes; thus, inhibition of LSD1 also promotes
      H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. Altogether, this
      may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells.
      LSD1, an enzyme belonging to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent
      amine oxidase family is overexpressed in certain tumor cells and plays a key
      role in the regulation of gene expression, tumor cell growth and survival.

      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the CD123-CD33 cCAR T cells
      specifically and simultaneously target and bind to tumor cells expressing CD123
      and/or CD33. This induces selective toxicity in tumor cells that express the
      CD123 antigen and/or the CD33 antigen. CD123 is normally expressed on committed

  CD73 Inhibitor AB680:
    Code: C167156
    Definition: A small molecule, competitive inhibitor of the ectoenzyme CD73 (cluster
      of differentiation 73; 5\'-ecto-nucleotidase; 5\'-NT; ecto-5\'-nucleotidase),
      with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      CD73 Inhibitor AB680 targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering of and
      internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of adenosine
      monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This prevents adenosine-mediated lymphocyte
      suppression and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells and natural
      killer (NK) cells. This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity
      of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs).
      By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic
      T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth decreases.
      In addition, clustering and internalization of CD73 decreases the migration
      of cancer cells and prevents metastasis. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging
      to the 5\'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, upregulated on a number of cancer cell
      types, catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to
      membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated
      immunosuppression within the TME.

  CD80-Fc Fusion Protein ALPN-202:
    Code: C174515
    Definition: A fusion protein composed of the N-terminal Ig variable-like (IgV)
      domain of CD80 fused to a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment, with potential
      immunostimulatory, immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, CD80-Fc fusion protein ALPN-202 targets and binds to programmed
      cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) expressed
      on tumor cells, which blocks its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed
      cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), and leads to PD-L1-dependent
      CD28 binding and co-stimulation in the local tumor microenvironment (TME). This
      reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, leads to the co-stimulation
      of T-cell responses including the activation of naive and memory T-cells in
      the TME and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune
      response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In addition, ALPN-202 targets
      and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) expressed on T-cells.
      This prevents the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, thereby enabling CD80-CD28
      engagement, CD28 signaling, and T-cell activation. This further promotes T-cell
      activity. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding
      to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.
      CD80 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated antigen presenting
      cells (APCs) that plays a key role in T-cell activation upon binding to CD28
      on T-cells. On the other hand, binding of CD80 to CTLA-4 prevents CD80-CD28
      engagement, thereby inhibiting T-cell activity and immune activation. CTLA-4
      is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and an inhibitory molecule
      upregulated by T-cells following T-cell activation. It plays a key role in the
      downregulation of the immune system.

    Definition: A recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain
      (ECD) of human CD80 (B7.1) fused to a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment,
      with potential immunostimulatory, immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration of CD80-Fc fusion protein FPT155, the CD80 moiety
      targets and binds to CD28, which in the presence of antigenic T-cell receptor
      (TCR) signaling, leads to the co-stimulation of T-cell responses including the
      activation of naive and memory T-cells. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer
      cells. FPT155 also targets and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4),
      preventing the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, thereby enabling CD80-CD28
      engagement, CD28 signaling, and T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment.

      PF-07104091 selectively targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK2.
      This may lead to cell cycle arrest, the induction of apoptosis, and the inhibition
      of tumor cell proliferation. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that are important
      regulators of cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation and are frequently
      overexpressed in tumor cells. CDK2/cyclin E complex plays an important role
      in retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation and the G1-S phase cell cycle

      leads to cell cycle arrest. This suppresses DNA replication and decreases tumor
      cell proliferation. CDK4 and 6 are serine/threonine kinases that are upregulated

      SY-5609 selectively targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK7, thereby
      inhibiting CDK7-mediated signaling. Specifically, inhibition of CDK7 prevents
      phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II, thereby
      preventing transcription of important cancer-promoting genes. In addition, it
      prevents phosphorylation of the cell cycle kinases CDK1, 2, 4, and 6, thereby
      disrupting uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Altogether, this may induce
      apoptosis, cause cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA damage repair and inhibit tumor
      cell proliferation in certain cancers that are dependent on CDK7-mediated transcriptional
      regulation and signaling. CDK7, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a role in controlling
      cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and promotes the expression
      of key oncogenes such as c-Myc and beta-catenin, through the phosphorylation
      of RNA polymerase II.

      kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) and cyclin-dependent kinases 7 and 9 (CDK7 and CDK9),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, BTX-A51 binds to
      and inhibits the activity of CK1alpha, CDK7, and CDK9. Blocking the phosphorylation
      and kinase activity of CK1alpha prevents the enhanced binding of murine double
      minute X (MDMX) to p53, the formation of CK1alpha and MDM2 complex, and the
      resulting inhibition of p53. This induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, slowing
      tumor cell proliferation. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of
      CDK7 and CDK9 prevents the positive transcription elongation factor b (PTEFb)-mediated
      activation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and leads to the inhibition of
      gene transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. This also induces cell
      cycle arrest and apoptosis, slowing tumor cell proliferation. CK1alpha, a serine/threonine
      kinase and a leukemic stem cell target, acts as a tumor suppressor in several
      cancers through the negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and p53.
      It negatively regulates p53 by phosphorylating MDMX, thus enhancing binding
      of MDMX to p53, as well as by forming a complex with MDM2. CDK7, a serine/threonine
      kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression, transcriptional
      regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such as c-Myc through
      the phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. CDK9, also a serine/threonine kinase, regulates
      elongation of transcription through phosphorylation of RNA Pol II at serine
      2 (p-Ser2-RNAPII). It is upregulated in various tumor cell types and plays a
      key role in the regulation of RNA Pol II-mediated transcription of anti-apoptotic
      proteins. Tumor cells are dependent on anti-apoptotic proteins for their survival.

    Definition: An antagonist of both the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)
      and E-selectin (CD62E), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration,
      CXCR4/E-selectin antagonist GMI-1359 binds to both CXCR4 and E-selectin expressed
      on endothelial cells. The binding to CXCR4 prevents the binding of stromal-cell
      derived factor-1 (SDF-1; CXCL12) to CXCR4 and inhibits CXCR4 activation, which
      may result in decreased proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing tumor
      cells. The binding to E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells prevents their
      interaction with E-selectin ligand-expressing cancer cells. This may prevent
      tumor cell activation, migration and metastasis. CXCR4, a chemokine receptor
      belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, plays an important
      role in chemotaxis and angiogenesis, and is upregulated in several tumor cell
      types. E-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule involved in cell rolling, signaling
      and chemotaxis. Its overexpression has been associated with tumor angiogenesis
      and metastasis in several cancers.

      CYP11A1 inhibitor ODM-209 targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of CYP11A1.
      This prevents the synthesis of all steroid hormones and their precursors. This
      may inhibit the proliferation of hormone-positive tumor cells. CYP11A1, a mitochondrial
      enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (Preg), which
      is the first rate-limiting step in steroid hormone biosynthesis.

    Definition: An orally bioavailable, non-steroidal, potent, reversible, dual inhibitor
      of cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17 or CYP17A1) and CYP11B2, with potential antiandrogen
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, LAE001 inhibits the
      enzymatic activity of CYP17A1 in both the testes and adrenal glands, thereby
      inhibiting androgen production. This may decrease androgen-dependent growth
      signaling and may inhibit cell proliferation of androgen-dependent tumor cells.
      LAE001 also inhibits the enzymatic activity of CYP11B2, thereby inhibiting aldosterone
      production. This may reduce the elevated aldosterone levels resulting from CYP17
      inhibition and androgen deprivation, leading to a reduction in mineralocorticoid
      side effects including cardiovascular complications. The cytochrome P450 enzyme
      CYP17A1, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, exhibits both 17alpha-hydroxylase
      and 17,20-lyase activities, and plays a key role in the steroidogenic pathway
      that produces steroidal hormones. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP11B2, aldosterone
      synthase, is an enzyme that plays a key role in aldosterone biosynthesis.

  Calcium Release-activated Channel Inhibitor CM4620:
    Code: C166417
    Definition: A calcium (Ca2+) release-activated channel (CRAC) inhibitor, with
      potential anti-inflammatory and protective activities. Upon administration,
      CM4620 targets, binds to and inhibits the calcium release-activated calcium
      channel protein 1 (Orai1), which forms the pore of CRAC, and is expressed on
      both parenchymal cells and immune cells. This prevents the transport of extracellular
      Ca2+ into the cell and inhibits the subsequent activation of Ca2+-mediated signaling
      and transcription of target genes. This may prevent Ca2+ entry-mediated cell
      death. It may also inhibit the proliferation of immune cells and prevents the
      release of various inflammatory cytokines in immune cells, such as interleukin-2
      (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). This may lead to a reduction
      of inflammatory responses in inflammatory-mediated diseases. CRACs, specialized
      plasma membrane Ca2+ ion channels composed of the plasma membrane based Orai
      channels and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal interaction molecules (STIMs),
      mediate store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and play a key role in calcium homeostasis.
      CRACs are overactivated in a variety of cell types, especially certain immune
      cells during inflammation, including T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages.

    Definition: An immunoconjugate consisting of a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal
      antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R
      alpha or CD25) and conjugated, via a cleavable linker, to a synthetic, cross-linking
      agent pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that targets DNA minor grooves, with
      potential antineoplastic activity. The monoclonal antibody portion of the anti-CD25
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ADCT-301 specifically binds to the cell surface
      antigen CD25. This causes the internalization of ADCT-301 and the subsequent
      release of the cytotoxic PBD moiety. The imine groups of the PBD moiety bind
      to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of DNA. This induces interstrand
      cross-links in the minor groove of DNA and inhibits DNA replication, which inhibits
      the proliferation of CD25-overexpressing tumor cells. CD25, a transmembrane
      receptor and tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is expressed on certain cancer

      combination agent ASTX030, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme
      primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes
      the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown
      of azacitidine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing
      GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of azacitidine. Azacitidine
      exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate
      form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby blocking
      DNA methylation and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes with
      DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.

  Chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes:
    Code: C167056
    Definition: A preparation of genetically modified T-lymphocytes transduced with
      a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprised of
      a CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domain fused to the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3
      complex (CD3zeta), a truncated form of CD19 (CD19t), an immunoglobulin (Ig)
      G4-Fc (EQ) spacer, and a peptide derived from chlorotoxin (CLTX), with potential
      imaging and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing
      CAR T-lymphocytes are re-directed to specific tumor cells in the brain inducing
      selective toxicity in these tumor cells. CLTX, a 36-amino acid peptide found
      in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and a chloride
      channel blocker, preferentially binds to glioma (and other neuroectodermal origin)
      cells via membrane bound forms of the endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2
      (MMP-2). This may direct the T-lymphocytes to and induce selective toxicity
      in MMP-2-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, binding to MMP-2 on glioma cells
      may both interfere with transmembrane chloride exchange and inhibit proteolytic
      extracellular matrix remodeling by MMP-2, which may further limit the spread
      of these tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically upregulated in gliomas and related
      cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule
      signaling domain enhances activation and signaling; its inclusion may increase
      proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of
      the CD3 zeta chain alone. IgG4-Fc (EQ) contains two point mutations in its spacer
      region which prevents recognition of the CAR by Fc receptors (FcRs) without
      altering the ability of the CAR to mediate antigen-specific lysis. CD19t, which
      lacks the cytoplasmic signaling tail, provides a non-immunogenic surface marker
      that allows for accurate measurement, efficient cell tracking and/or imaging
      of the therapeutic T-cells in vivo following adoptive transfer. Additionally,
      co-expression of CD19t functions as a \"suicide\" switch via clinically available
      antibodies or immunotoxins which can be used to selectively eliminate the genetically
      modified cells.

      growth factor receptor (HER2) monoclonal antibody linked to a CD137-targeting
      anticalin with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration of cinrebafusp alfa, CD137 clustering is promoted by bridging
      CD137-positive T-cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, leading to the recruitment
      of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in
      potent CTL-mediated lysis of HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2 plays a key role
      in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. CD137 is a costimulatory
      immunoreceptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
      (TNFRSF). Anticalins are synthetic antigen-binding proteins derived from lipocalins.

  Cintirorgon:
    Code: C131294
    Definition: An orally bioavailable agonist of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
      gamma (RORg), with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon oral administration of cintirorgon, this agent selectively binds to the
      nuclear receptor transcription factor RORg, forming a receptor complex that
      translocates to the nucleus, and binds to ROR response elements (ROREs), enhancing
      the function, proliferation and survival of type 17 T-cells, including Th17
      (helper T-cells) and Tc17 (cytotoxic T-cells). This may increase the expression
      of co-stimulatory molecules and decrease the expression of co-inhibitory molecules
      on T-cells leading to increased production of cytokines and chemokines by T-cells,
      decreased proliferation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and abrogation of tumor-induced
      immunosuppression. This ultimately induces a T-cell-mediated immune response
      against cancer cells and leads to a reduction in tumor cell growth. RORg, the
      nuclear receptor transcription factor that is involved in Th17/Tc17 differentiation,
      plays a key role in immune activation.

      reference DNA to generate a map of DNA copy number changes in tumor genomes.
      Comparative genomic hybridization is an ideal tool for analyzing chromosomal
      imbalances in archived tumor material and for examining possible correlations
      between these findings and tumor phenotypes. (from Ried et al. J Mol Med 1997

    Definition: An orally bioavailable ATP-competitive inhibitor of DNA-dependent
      protein kinase (DNA-PK), with potential chemo/radiosensitizing and antineoplastic
      activites. Upon oral administration, DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648 selectively targets,
      binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA-PK, thereby interfering with the non-homologous
      end joining (NHEJ) process and preventing repair of DNA double strand breaks
      (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases
      chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity leading to enhanced tumor cell death. AZD7648
      may also increase the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
      and may work as a monotherapy in tumors with high endogenous levels of DNA damage
      resulting from defects in other DNA repair pathways. The enhanced ability of
      tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor cells
      to chemo- and radiotherapy. DNA-PK plays a key role in the NHEJ pathway and
      DSB repair.

      (PI3-kinase subunit delta; PI3K-delta; PI3Kdelta) and DNA-dependent protein
      kinase (DNA-PK), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities.
      Upon oral administration, the DNA-PK/PI3K-delta inhibitor BR101801 inhibits
      the activity of both PI3K-delta and DNA-PK. This prevents PI3K-mediated signaling
      pathways and may lead to the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K-overexpressing
      tumor cells. Specifically, since PI3K regulates c-myc expression, inhibition
      of PI3K signaling may lead to a decrease in proliferation of c-myc-expressing
      tumor cells. Also, by inhibiting the activity of DNA-PK, this agent interferes
      with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) process and prevents the repair of
      DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic
      treatment. This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity by inhibiting
      the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. The PI3K pathway is upregulated
      in a variety of tumors and plays an important role in regulating cancer cell
      proliferation, growth, and survival. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and
      plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks. The enhanced ability
      of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor
      cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition, BR101801 is able to decrease

      inhibitor NTX-301 targets ad binds to DNMT1, thereby inhibiting the activity
      of DNMT1. This may prevent DNA methylation, induce DNA hypomethylation, and
      activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation. This may inhibit
      tumor cell proliferation. DNMT1, a member of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
      family, plays an important role in maintaining the DNA methylation pattern.

  DTRMWXHS-12/Everolimus/Pomalidomide Combination Agent DTRM-555:
    Code: C173999
    Definition: An orally bioavailable combination of DTRMWXHS-12, a Bruton\'s tyrosine
      kinase (BTK) inhibitor, everolimus, a mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor,
      and pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), that may be used for the
      treatment of B-cell malignancies. Upon oral administration of DTRM-555, the
      DTRMWXHS-12 component inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation
      of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell
      activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, and
      leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK.
      BTK plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation
      and survival of B-lymphocytes. The everolimus component binds to the immunophilin
      FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits
      the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase. Upregulated in some tumors,
      mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cellular proliferation,
      motility, and survival that is located downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling
      pathway. The pomalidomide component may inhibit TNF-alpha production, enhance
      the activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and enhance antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, pomalidomide may inhibit tumor angiogenesis,
      promote cell cycle arrest in susceptible tumor cell populations, and stimulate
      erythropoiesis. The combination of a BTK inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor and an
      IMiD may work synergistically to kill malignant B-cells and prevent drug resistance.

      cluster of differentiation 38 (CD-38; CD38), and a recombinant form of human
      hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon subcutaneous
      administration of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj, daratumumab targets and
      binds to CD38 on certain CD38-expressing tumors, such as multiple myeloma (MM)
      and plasma cell leukemia. This binding induces direct apoptosis through Fc-mediated
      cross-linking and triggers immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent
      cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) immune responses. CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein,
      is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineage cells. Hyaluronidase-fihj
      hydrolyzes and degrades the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), thereby
      decreasing interstitial viscosity and enhancing penetration of daratumumab through

  Decitabine and Cedazuridine:

    Definition: An orally available fixed-dose combination agent containing cedazuridine,
      a cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor, and the cytidine antimetabolite decitabine,
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration of tdecitabine
      and cedazuridine, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily
      found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination
      of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown of decitabine,
      increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing GI toxicity due
      to the administration of lower doses of decitabine. Decitabine exerts its antineoplastic
      activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which
      inhibits DNA methyltransferase and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes
      with DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.

  Delolimogene Mupadenorepvec:
    Code: C148462
    Definition: A double-armed oncolytic adenovirus composed of a recombinant genetically
      modified E1/E3-deleted, adenoviral serotype 5 (Ad5) vector, with the L5 segment
      of the Ad5 fiber replaced by the shaft and knob from the Ad35 serotype (Ad5/35),
      which expresses a trimerized (TMZ) form of the membrane-bound immunostimulator
      CD40 ligand (CD40L; TNFSF5) and the ligand for the signaling domain 4-1BB (4-1BBL;
      CD137L; TNFSF9), under the control of a CMV promoter, with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral administration of delolimogene
      mupadenorepvec, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells.
      This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune
      system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further
      killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells,
      including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants
      CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L-
      and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages. The DCs produce
      various cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL12), IL21, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNFa), and interferon-gamma (IFNg), which leads to the activation and expansion
      of both T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Altogether, this modulates immune
      suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), disrupts tumor stroma, and
      causes additional immune stimulation against tumor cells, thereby inducing further
      tumor cell lysis. In addition, CD40L reduces myeloid suppressor cells in the
      TME. Inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/35 fiber targets CD46 and increases viral
      uptake in cells. Transgene expression is driven by a separate promoter to allow
      for efficient expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma. Replication is
      restricted to tumor cells by the presence of the delta24 mutation in the E1A
      gene, which deletes the retinoplastoma protein (pRb)-binding domain and forces
      viral replication to be conditional on hyperphosphorylated pRb and a dysfunctional
      Rb pathway.

      inhibitor AZD4320 that is chemically conjugated to a proprietary 5-generation
      pegylated poly-lysine dendrimer via a hydrolytically labile linker, with potential
      pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of AZD0466,
      AZD4320 is released through hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. AZD4320 is a
      Bcl2-homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic that specifically binds to and inhibits
      the activity of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. This restores
      apoptotic processes and inhibits cell proliferation in Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-dependent
      tumor cells. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family that are
      overexpressed in many cancers, play an important role in the negative regulation
      of apoptosis. Their expression in tumors is associated with increased drug resistance
      and cancer cell survival. The conjugation of AZD 4320 to the dendrimer construct
      may allow extended release of the agent, which may improve efficacy and lower
      toxicity.

    Definition: A dual-specific, tetravalent immunoglobulin (Ig) G-like molecule targeting
      two as of yet not publicly known targets, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      The target-binding variable domains of two monoclonal antibodies, which are
      not publicly known, are combined, via linkers, to create the tetravalent, dual-targeting
      single agent ABT-165. Upon administration of dual variable domain immunoglobulin
      (DVD-Ig) ABT-165, the target-binding variable domains specifically recognize
      and simultaneously bind to their two antigens expressed on tumor cells. This
      may both prevent antigen-mediated signaling and lead to an inhibition of cellular
      proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. The antigen targets are overexpressed
      on certain tumor cell types. The DVD-Ig may have enhanced physicochemical and
      pharmacokinetic properties as compared to their antibody counterparts.

  Dociparstat sodium:
    Code: C99130
    Definition: A heparin derivative in which the 2-O and 3-O sulfate groups of heparin
      are removed and that lacks anticoagulant activity, with potential anti-inflammatory,
      immodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, dociparstat
      sodium binds to both chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12)
      and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). This prevents the interaction of CXCL12
      with CXCR4, blocks CXCR4 activation, and may result in decreased proliferation
      and migration in CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of
      CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from
      the bone marrow into the blood.  In addition, dociparstat sodium prevents the
      interaction of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with
      its ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), Mac-1(CD11b/CD18),
      the nuclear pro-inflammatory protein high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1),
      carboxymethyl lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) and members of the S100
      calgranulin family. In addition, this agent inhibits the enzymes heparanase,
      cathepsin G, and human leukocyte elastase, which are involved in inflammation
      and metastasis. Altogether, this may inhibit tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis.
      Dociparstat sodium also binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and may prevent
      PF4\'s inhibitory effect on platelet production. This may increase platelet
      production. Unlike heparin, this agent does not induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
      (HIT). RAGE, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a
      key role in inflammation and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. CXCR4
      is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family
      that plays an important role in chemotaxis, chemoresistance and angiogenesis,
      and is upregulated in several tumor cell types. The interaction between CXCL12/CXCR4
      induces retention of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.

      as an immune checkpoint protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation
      and T-cell-mediated immune responses when activated by its ligands programmed

      consists of the injection of SQL70 at the tumor site followed by the intravenous
      administration of SQ3370, the prodrug SQP33 binds to, through an as of yet not
      identifiable mechanism, to SQL70 at the tumor site. After binding, doxorubicin
      is released over a period of days, intercalates into DNA and interacts with
      topoisomerase II. This leads to an inhibition of DNA replication and repair,
      and prevents RNA and protein synthesis. Compared to the systemic administration
      of doxorubicin alone, SQ3370 may allow for higher and sustained delivery of
      active doxorubicin directly to the tumor, which may increase its efficacy and
      limit its off-site, systemic toxicity.

      that shows similar activity against certain activating mutations, including
      exon 20 insertions (exon20ins), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon

      human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration of EGFR/TGFb fusion monoclonal antibody BCA101,
      the anti-EGFR moiety targets, binds to and prevents activation of EGFR-mediated
      signaling. This leads to an inhibition of EGFR-dependent downstream pathways
      and EGFR-dependent tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. The anti-TGFb moiety
      targets and binds to TGFb, thereby preventing the activation of TGFb-mediated
      signaling pathways. This may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in which

  EGFR/VEGFR/RET Inhibitor HA121-28:
    Code: C173436
    Definition: An orally available inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR), the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transfection
      (RET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), with potential
      anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration of HA121-28,
      this agent targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR, RET and VEGFR.
      This prevents EGFR-, RET- and VEGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to the
      induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-, RET- and VEGFR-overexpressing
      cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays
      a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. Dysregulation
      of RET activity plays a key role in the development and progression of a variety
      of cancers. Expression of VEGFR is upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types;
      it plays a key role in the migration, proliferation and survival of endothelial
      cells, microvessel formation, the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and
      tumor cell death.

  EP2/EP4 Antagonist TPST-1495:
    Code: C174460
    Definition: An orally bioavailable, dual antagonist of the human prostaglandin
      E2 receptor subtypes 2 (EP2) and 4 (EP4), with potential immunomodulating and
      antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, the EP2/EP4 antagonist
      TPST-1495 selectively targets and binds to EP2 and EP4, inhibiting the binding
      of the immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to EP2 and EP4. This prevents
      the activation of EP2 and EP4, and inhibits PGE2-EP2/EP4-mediated signaling.
      This inhibits PGE2-driven immune suppression by preventing the PGE2-mediated
      inhibition of anti-tumor immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment
      (TME), such as natural killer (NK) cells, T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs)
      and M1 macrophages, and blocking the PGE2-mediated increase in suppressive immune
      cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 macrophages, and
      regulatory T cells (Tregs). This inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells in
      which the PGE2-EP2/4 signaling pathway is over-activated. EP2 and EP4, G protein-coupled
      receptors (GPCRs) that are overexpressed in certain types of cancers, promote
      tumor cell proliferation, invasion, survival, and metastasis.

      to EP4. This prevents the activation of EP4 and inhibits PGE2-EP4-mediated signaling,
      thereby inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells in which the PGE2-EP4 signaling
      pathway is over-activated. In addition, EP4 inhibition prevents the activity
      of tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME)
      by inhibiting interleukin-23 (IL-23) production and the IL-23-mediated expansion
      of Th17 cells. EP4, a prostanoid receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that
      is expressed in certain types of cancers; it promotes tumor cell proliferation

      with immune enhancer molecules C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), C-X-C motif
      chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and interferon alpha (IFNalpha), with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of NG-641, EnAd specifically
      infects and replicates in tumor cells and not in normal, noncancerous tissue,
      and selectively expresses FAP-TAc. The locally expressed FAP-TAc targets and
      binds to both fibroblast activating protein (FAP) on cancer associated fibroblasts
      (CAFs) and CD3 on T-cells. This leads to T-cell activation and T-cell mediated
      killing of CAFs in tumor stroma. NG-641 also encodes the transgenes CXCL9, CXCL10
      and IFNalpha. The production of CXCL9, CXCL10 and IFNalpha leads to the recruitment
      and further activation of T-cells, enhancing the overall immune response and
      cancer cell killing. FAP, a cell surface glycoprotein, is overexpressed on tumor-associated
      fibroblasts but minimally expressed on normal, healthy cells.

  Encapsulated Rapamycin:
    Code: C173879
    Definition: An orally bioavailable nanoparticle-based formulation composed of
      sub-micron particles of the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin incorporated into
      a pH-sensitive poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer, with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration of the encapsulated
      rapamycin, the nanoparticle specifically delivers rapamycin at the tumor site.
      Rapamycin binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate
      a complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of the serine/threonine
      kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This may
      suppress mTORC1 activity. In addition, inhibition of mTOR may modulate central
      memory CD8 T cells, CD3+/CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 T-cell responses.
      This may kill tumor cells. Compared to the administration of rapamycin alone,
      this formulation improves oral bioavailability of rapamycin with more consistent
      rapamycin levels, thereby allowing for administration of lower rapamycin dosage,
      which improves and minimizes rapamycin\'s toxicity. Upregulated in some tumors,
      mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cellular proliferation,
      motility, and survival that is located downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling
      pathway.

      LAG-3), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration,encelimab binds to LAG3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific
      T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which
      leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
      (IgSF), is expressed on various immune cells, and negatively regulates both
      proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is associated
      with tumor-mediated immune suppression.

      administration, the ETBR blocker ENB 003 selectively targets and binds to ETBR
      expressed on tumor cells. This prevents ETBR-mediated signaling and may abrogate
      the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), may enhance a T-cell mediated
      anti-tumor immune response and may inhibit proliferation of ETBR-expressing
      tumor cells. ETBR, a G-protein coupled receptor, is overexpressed in a variety
      of tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, invasion,
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. It also plays a role
      in tumor immunosuppression and blocks T-cell trafficking.

    Definition: A preparation of allogeneic, off-the-shelf (OTS) red blood cells (RBCs)
      engineered to express both the co-stimulatory molecule tumor necrosis factor
      ligand superfamily (TNFSF) member 9 (TNFSF9; 4-1BBL) and a fusion protein composed
      of the trans-presented cytokine interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15-receptor alpha (IL-15Ra)
      (IL-15TP) with potential modulating and antineoplastic activities. CD34+ hematopoietic
      precursor cells (HPC) are collected by apheresis from a healthy O negative donor,
      purified, and engineered with a lentiviral vector to express 4-1BBL and IL-15TP.
      The cells are then further expanded and differentiated until the nucleus is
      ejected, resulting in a mature reticulocyte. Upon administration of the engineered
      red blood cells co-expressing 4-1BBL and IL-15TP RTX-240, the RBCs express both
      4-1BBL and IL-15TP on their cell surfaces. 4-1BBL and IL-15TP bind to and subsequently
      induce the proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells.
      This enhances the secretion of cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and results
      in the induction of an anti-tumor immune response.

      immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), with
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory activity. Upon administration, etigilimab
      binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, including T-cells, and prevents
      the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor
      related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5;
      NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory
      receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune
      cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8-positive T-cells, and leads
      to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune
      system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT,
      a member of the Ig super family and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key
      role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved

  Extended Release Metformin Hydrochloride:
    Code: C173523
    Definition: An extended-release (ER) tablet composed of the hydrochloride salt
      form of the biguanide metformin, with antihyperglycemic and potential prostate-cancer
      protective and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, metformin
      targets and inhibits complex I (NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial
      respiratory chain and increases the cellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio leading to activation of AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK). This modulates AMPK-mediated transcription of target genes, which
      prevents hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose,
      enhances insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose
      uptake and utilization in target tissues. This lowers blood glucose levels.
      Metformin may exert antineoplastic effects through AMPK-mediated or AMPK-independent
      inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is up-regulated in
      many cancer tissues. It also reduces cyclin D1. This inhibits cancer cell proliferation.
      Furthermore, this agent also inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by inhibiting
      matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression which is mediated through the
      suppression of transcription activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. Also, metformin
      reduces hyperinsulinemia which may contribute to an anti-tumor effect. Metformin
      may increase the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and may lower
      serum PSA levels.

  FAK/ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor APG-2449:
    Code: C172193
    Definition: An orally available kinase inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the receptor
      tyrosine kinase C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration, ALK/FAK/ROS1 inhibitor APG-2449 selectively binds to and
      inhibits ALK, FAK and ROS1 kinases. The inhibition leads to disruption of ALK-,
      FAK- and ROS1-mediated signal transduction pathways and eventually inhibits
      tumor cell growth in ALK-, FAK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs
      to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system
      development; its dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a
      variety of tumors. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FAK, a signal transducer
      for integrins, is upregulated and constitutively activated in various tumor
      types; it plays a key role in tumor cell migration, proliferation, survival,
      and tumor angiogenesis. ROS1, overexpressed in certain cancer cells, plays a
      key role in cell growth and survival of cancer cells.

      FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3; CD135; STK1; FLK2), the mast/stem cell factor
      receptor c-Kit (SCFR; KIT) and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R;
      CSF-1R; C-FMS; CD115; M-CSFR), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating
      activities Upon administration, FLT3/KIT/CSF1R inhibitor NMS-03592088 binds
      to and inhibits the activity of FLT3, KIT and CSF1R. This prevents FLT3, KIT
      and CSF1R-mediated signaling and results in the inhibition of proliferation
      in tumor cells overexpressing FLT3, KIT and CSF1R. In addition, NMS-03592088

      and monocytes and reduces inflammation. By blocking the recruitment to the tumor
      microenvironment and activity of CSF1R-dependent tumor-associated macrophages
      (TAMs), NMS-03592088 inhibits the immunomodulating activity by macrophages and
      enhances T-cell infiltration and antitumor T-cell immune responses, which inhibits
      the proliferation of tumor cells. FLT3, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase
      (RTK), is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage neoplasms and in acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML), and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. c-Kit,
      a transmembrane protein and receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in solid

      5. The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

      been incubated with the recombinant human Fas ligand (FasL) APO010 ex vivo,
      and that can potentially be used for immune reconstitution purposes. The incubation
      of the hematopoietic stem cell graft with the apoptotic mediator Fas ligand
      (FasL) selectively induces apoptosis of mature T-cells which express high levels
      of Fas receptor, such as T stem cell memory (TSCM), T central memory (TCM),
      and T effector memory (TEM) cells and the pro-inflammatory T-helper cells (Th)
      Th1 and Th17 subsets while sparing CD34-positive stem and progenitor cells.
      Upon washing and further ex vivo preparations, and upon allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with the FasL-treated allogeneic MPBCs, these
      cells provide hematopoietic cell recovery, preserve the graft-versus-leukemia
      (GvL) effects, and may prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).

    Definition: A humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed
      against the inhibitory receptor lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG3),
      with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, favezelimab binds to LAG3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
      II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes
      and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction
      in tumor growth. LAG3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is
      expressed on various immune cells, and negatively regulates both proliferation
      and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated
      immune suppression.

      Upon intratumoral administration, 2141-V11 targets and binds to CD40 on a variety
      of immune cell types. This induces CD40-dependent signaling pathways, triggers
      the proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activates
      T-cells. This results in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune
      response against tumor cells. CD40, a cell surface receptor and member of the
      tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on various
      immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and B-cells, and plays
      a key role in the activation of the immune system.

      potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, fenretinide
      binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby inducing cell
      differentiation and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cell types. Fenretinide also
      binds to and inhibits the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
      which may result in both the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease
      in tumor cell proliferation. Independent of RAR activation and mTOR inhibition,
      this agent may also modulate gene expression that leads to ceramide-induced,

  Flt3 Ligand/Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody/IL-12 Engineered Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus RIVAL-01:
    Code: C174049
    Definition: An oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV; VACV) genetically engineered to express
      an Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligand, an antibody directed against the
      human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
      (CTLA-4) and the human pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12), with
      potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration
      of the Flt3 ligand/anti-CTLA-4 antibody/IL-12 engineered oncolytic VV RIVAL-01,
      the virus preferentially targets, infects and replicates in tumor cells, causing
      oncolysis. In turn, the lysed tumor cells release various tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs), which induce an immune response against the tumor cells. In addition,
      the Flt3 ligand, the anti-ctla-4 antibody and IL-12 are expressed by the VV
      in the cancer cells and may activate the immune system within the tumor microenvironment
      (TME), thereby stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. The anti-CTLA-4
      antibody targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated
      downregulation of T-cell activation, which promotes T-cell activation. Flt3
      ligand binds to the Flt3 tyrosine kinase receptor and promotes Flt3 signaling
      which plays an important role in expanding the population of antigen-presenting
      dendritic cells (DCs). IL-12 activates natural killer cells (NKs), induces the
      secretion of interferon-gamma and promotes CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses against
      tumor cells, which may result in immune-mediated tumor cell death and inhibition
      of tumor cell proliferation.

      18, that can potentially be used as a tracer for imaging of activated T-lymphocytes
      during positron emission tomography (PET). Upon administration, fluorine F 18
      ara-G is taken up by and accumulates in activated T-lymphocytes with high levels
      of DCK and dGK. After phosphorylation by DCK and dGK, the 18F moiety can be

  Fosgemcitabine Palabenamide:
    Code: C102752
    Definition: 'A pyrimidine analogue and a proprietary prodrug based on an aryloxy
      phosphoramidate derivative of gemcitabine with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon intravenous administration and cellular uptake, fosgemcitabine palabenamide
      is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate
      (dFdCDP, dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing
      the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated
      into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually
      induction of apoptosis. With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate
      group, NUC-1031 has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more
      lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not
      require a nucleoside transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate
      form, the first phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required,
      3) this agent is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage
      of the monophosphorylated form. Altogether, this may help overcome resistance
      to gemcitabine.'

  Fosifloxuridine Nafalbenamide:
    Code: C156680
    Definition: A phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of
      5-fluoro-2\'-deoxyuridine (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil
      (5-FU), an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside,
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide
      analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide
      is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety
      is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form
      FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting
      in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With
      the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide,
      compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive
      diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating
      higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside
      the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active
      form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or
      converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and
      thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less
      toxicity.

      and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This leads to an inhibition of tumor
      cell proliferation. GPER activation may also induce immune memory. GPER is a
      membrane protein and a member of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that
      are widely distributed in various tissues. GPER is a tumor suppressor in a wide
      range of cell cancer types.

      the active moiety of DRP-104, irreversibly inhibits multiple enzymes involved
      in glutamine metabolism. Blocking glutamine metabolism inhibits proliferation
      in rapidly growing tumor cells and leads to an induction of cell death. Unlike
      normal healthy cells, glutamine-dependent tumors rely heavily on the intracellular
      conversion of exogenous glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites to
      both provide energy and generate building blocks for the production of macromolecules,
      which are needed for cellular growth and survival. In addition, blocking glutamine
      metabolism leads to the accumulation of glutamine in tumor cells and increases
      glutamine concentration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon tumor cell
      death. As glutamine is essential for T-cell generation, DON may also enhance
      T-cell proliferation and activation in the TME, which may lead to further killing
      of tumor cells. The conversion of DRP-104 to the active moiety DON occurs primarily
      in tumor cells, allowing glutamine metabolism in healthy cells which may lessen

    Definition: A neoplasm arising in the ovary or testis. It is composed of granulosa
      cells, Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and fibroblasts. Each of these cell types
      may constitute the only cellular component that is present in the neoplasm or
      it may be mixed with other cell types in various combinations. The prognosis
      can not always be predicted on histologic grounds alone. Approximately, 10%
      of these tumors may metastasize. Representative examples include granulosa cell
      tumor, Leydig cell tumor, Sertoli cell tumor, and tumors of the thecoma-fibroma
      group.

      Histones are basic nuclear proteins responsible for the nucleosome structure
      of chromatin. Repeating nucleosome units contain two molecules each of Histones
      H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 that form an octamer complex around which approximately
      146 base pairs of DNA is wrapped. Linker Histone H1 interacts with DNA between
      nucleosome units in mediating chromatin compaction into higher order structures.

    Definition: An orally bioavailable, blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrable inhibitor
      of the receptor tyrosine kinase human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2;
      ErbB2; HER-2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration,
      HER2 inhibitor DZD1516 selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of HER2.
      This prevents HER2-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in HER2-expressing
      tumor cells. HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed on a variety of
      tumor cell types, plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor
      vascularization.

      factor receptor 2 (EGFR2; HER2; ErbB2), with potential immunostimulating and
      antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, HER2 tri-specific NK cell engager
      DF1001 targets and binds to HER2 on tumor cells and simultaneously binds to
      NK cells, thereby bringing HER2-expressing tumor cells and NK cells together,
      which stimulates the NK cells and results in the selective NK cell-mediated
      tumor cell lysis of HER2-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HER2-expressing
      tumor cells and NK cells may also lead to the activation of T-cells and B-cells,
      potentiating the immune response against HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2,
      a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mutated or overexpressed in many tumor cell
      types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

  HER2-directed TLR8 Agonist SBT6050:
    Code: C174010
    Definition: An immunotherapeutic composed of a monoclonal antibody directed against
      the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (EGFR2; HER2; ErbB2) conjugated to a Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8; CD288) agonist,
      with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous
      administration of the HER2-directed TLR8 agonist SBT6050, the anti-HER2 monoclonal
      antibody targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor cells, thereby localizing
      the TLR8 agonist directly to the tumor site. In turn, the TLR8 agonist moiety
      binds to TLR8 expressed on myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
      This activates myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
      myeloid cell-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), and conventional dendritic cells
      (cDCs). This may lead to the activation of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B, the production
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, macrophage-induced tumor cell
      killing, inflammasome activation, activation of cytolytic natural killer (NK)
      cells and neutrophils, and the induction of a Th1-weighted anti-tumor immune
      response. It also reverses the suppression of senescent naive and tumor-specific
      T-cells, and enhances the anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response.
      TLR8, like other TLRs, recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
      and plays a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. HER2, a tyrosine kinase
      receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.

      both recombinant humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against the tyrosine
      kinase receptor (TKR) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; HER-2;
      receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2), and hyaluronidase-zzxf, a biosimilar
      of the recombinant form of the naturally occurring endoglycosidase hyaluronidase,
      with antineoplastic activity that can be used for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing
      breast cancers. Upon subcutaneous administration, hyaluronidase-zzxf temporarily
      breaks down the hyaluronan barrier, which decreases viscosity of, and allows
      both pertuzumab and trastuzumab to spread rapidly through the interstitial space.
      This improves access to lymphatic and capillary vessels and facilitates the
      absorption of both antibodies into the bloodstream. Pertuzumab targets and binds
      to the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2 and blocks ligand-dependent
      heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3
      and HER4. This inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling and prevents
      the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in
      HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, respectively. Trastuzumab targets and binds
      to subdomain IV of HER2 and inhibits ligand-independent, HER2 mediated cell
      proliferation and inhibits the PI3K signaling pathway in HER2-overexpressing
      tumor cells. Both antibodies induce an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
      (ADCC) against HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2 is overexpressed in many adenocarcinomas,
      particularly breast adenocarcinomas.

  IDH1 Mutant Inhibitor LY3410738:
    Code: C175542
    Definition: An orally available inhibitor of mutant form of the isocitrate dehydrogenase
      type 1 (IDH1; IDH-1; IDH1 [NADP+] soluble), including the substitution mutation
      at arginine (R) in position 132, IDH1(R132), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon oral administration, IDH1 mutant inhibitor LY3410738 specifically and covalently
      binds to and modifies a single cysteine (Cys269) in the allosteric binding pocket
      of mutant forms of IDH1, thereby inactivating IDH1. This inhibits the formation
      of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG).
      This depletes 2-HG levels, prevents 2HG-mediated signaling and leads to both
      an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation
      in tumor cells expressing mutant forms of IDH1. In addition, LY3410738 has the
      ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). IDH1 mutations, including IDH1(R132)
      mutations, are highly expressed in certain malignancies, including gliomas;

  IDO/TDO Inhibitor LY-01013:
    Code: C171343
    Definition: An orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
      1 (IDO1; IDO-1) and the kynurenine-producing hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
      (TDO), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      IDO1/TDO inhibitor LY-01013 specifically targets and binds to both IDO1, a cytosolic
      enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan into the immunosuppressive
      metabolite kynurenine, and TDO, a hepatic enzyme catalyzing the first step of
      tryptophan degradation. By inhibiting IDO1 and TDO, LY-01013 decreases kynurenine
      levels in tumor cells, restores tryptophan and promotes the proliferation and
      activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), natural
      killer (NK) cells and T-lymphocytes. This reduces the number of tumor-associated
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and activates the immune system to induce a cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the IDO1/TDO-expressing tumor cells, thereby
      inhibiting the growth of the tumor cells. IDO1 and TDO, both overexpressed by
      multiple tumor cell types, play important roles in immunosuppression and the
      promotion of tumor cell survival and proliferation. Tryptophan depletion inhibits
      T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and subsequently suppresses the immune
      system.

      IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2; TDO-2), with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, IDO1/TDO2 inhibitor M4112
      targets, binds to and inhibits both IDO1 and TDO2, which catalyze the first
      and rate-limiting step in the production of the immunosuppressive transcription
      factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand kynurenine (Kyn). This inhibits
      the IDO1/TDO2-Kyn-AhR pathway and abrogates AhR activation. This prevents the
      activation of immune-tolerant dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs)
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and may restore the immune response by
      stimulating a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against tumor cells
      in which IDO1 and/or TDO2 are overexpressed. The IDO1/TDO2-KYN-AhR pathway is
      overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types and plays a key role in immunosuppression.
      Its expression is correlated with poor prognosis.

      at the DNA level joins a D segment with a J segment; a V segment is then joined
      to the D-J gene. The C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level.
      Recombination of many different V segments with several D and J segments provides
      a wide range of antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional
      diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase,
      and by somatic hypermutation, which occurs during B cell maturation in the spleen
      and lymph nodes. (from LocusLink)

  Iadademstat:
    Code: C131908
    Definition: An orally available inhibitor of lysine specific histone demethylase
      1 (KDM1A; LSD1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration,
      iadademstat binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression
      of target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at
      position 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4, respectively.
      LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor
      suppressor genes. This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing
      tumor cells. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9, which
      increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of LSD1 promotes
      H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. LSD1, an enzyme
      belonging to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family,
      is overexpressed in certain tumor cells and plays a key role in in the regulation
      of gene expression, tumor cell growth and survival.

  Idetrexed:
    Code: C120550
    Definition: An alpha-folate receptor (aFR)-mediated inhibitor of thymidylate synthase
      (TS), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous infusion, idetrexed
      selectively targets and binds to aFR-expressing tumor cells. Upon uptake by
      aFR, this agent binds to and inhibits TS. This reduces thymine nucleotide synthesis,
      inhibits both DNA synthesis and cell division, and leads to tumor cell apoptosis.
      TS catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine
      monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor for DNA synthesis, and plays a
      key role in cell growth and division. aFR, a cell-surface receptor glycoprotein,

      activities. Upon administration, Ieramilimab binds to LAG-3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific
      T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which
      leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG-3, a member of the immunoglobulin
      superfamily (IgSF) and expressed on various immune cells, negatively regulates
      cellular proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is

  Ilginatinib:
    Code: C98109
    Definition: An orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of Janus-associated
      kinase 2 (JAK2) and Src-family kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Ilginatinib competes with ATP for binding to JAK2 as well as the mutated form
      JAK2V617F, thereby inhibiting the activation of JAK2 and downstream molecules
      in the JAK2/STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling
      pathway that plays an important role in normal development, particularly hematopoiesis.
      In addition, ilginatinib inhibits the Src family tyrosine kinases. This eventually
      leads to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. JAK2 is the most common mutated
      gene in bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs); JAK2V617F is a
      constitutively activated kinase that activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
      and dysregulates cell growth and function, and its expression transforms hematopoietic
      cells to cytokine-independent growth.

    Code: C148039
    Definition: An orally bioavailable antagonist of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR;
      ADORA2A), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, imaradenant selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed
      on T-lymphocytes. This blocks tumor-released adenosine from interacting with
      A2AR and prevents the adenosine/A2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This
      results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates
      a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled
      receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation
      by adenosine, inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often
      overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression.

      binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, preventing the activation and subsequent
      dimerization of the receptor; the decrease in receptor activation and dimerization
      may result in an inhibition of downstream ERK and JNK signaling pathways and
      so inhibition of EGFR-dependent tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.  EGFR,

      activity. Although the exact mechanisms through which imifoplatin exerts its
      effect have yet to be fully elucidated, this agent, upon intravenous administration,
      binds to certain transmembrane proteins and activates several genes involved
      in tumor suppression and apoptosis. This leads to the activation of various
      signal transduction pathways, induces S/G2 phase cell cycle, and causes tumor
      cell apoptosis. In addition, imifoplatin may inhibit angiogenesis. Unlike conventional
      Pt-based chemotherapeutics, imifoplatin does not bind to DNA and is able to
      overcome drug resistance, which occurs with conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics;

      tumor cells that overexpress integrins such as alpha v beta 3 (avb3), alpha
      v beta 5 (avb5) and alpha v beta 6 (avb6) and the IL-15 moiety binds to the
      IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta-common gamma chain (IL-2Rbetagamma) receptor on natural
      killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. This activates and increases the levels
      of NK cells and memory CD8+ T-cells. The memory T-cells enhance the secretion
      of the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g), which further potentiates the immune
      response against tumor cells. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease
      tumor cell proliferation. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T- and NK cell development, activation
      and proliferation. Integrins are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and
      metastasis and they are overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types. The
      linkage of the two moieties may limit the effects of IL-15 to the local tumor

      Upon intradermal administration of irradiated allogeneic human lung cancer cells
      expressing OX40L-Ig vaccine HS-130, the irradiated lung cancer cells continuously
      express OX40L-Ig. OX40L may then target, bind to and activate its cognate receptor,
      tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4; OX40; CD134),
      which is expressed on activated T-cells. OX40L/OX40 binding promotes increased
      cytokine production, and induces the proliferation and activation of memory
      and effector T-lymphocytes against the human lung cancer cells. In turn, this
      promotes a CTL-mediated immune response against the endogenous lung cancer cells.
      OX40L, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      ligand family, provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival
      of activated T-cells.

    Definition: A bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal
      growth factor receptor ErbB3 (Her3) and the human insulin-like growth factor-1
      receptor (IGF-1R), with potential antineoplastic activity. The anti-IGF-1R targeting
      arm of Istiratumab binds to IGF-1R on tumor cells thereby preventing the binding
      of the natural ligands IGF-1, 2 and heregulin (HRG) to IGF-1R; the anti-ErbB3
      therapeutic arm prevents the binding of neuregulin (NRG) to ErbB3. This prevents
      the activation of the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway and may result in
      both the induction of apoptosis and a decrease in cellular proliferation in
      IGF-1R and ErbB3-overexpressing tumor cells. IGF-1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase
      of the insulin receptor superfamily, and ErB3, a member of the epidermal growth

      of chromatin remodeling and an altered pattern of gene expression. In particular,
      this agent enhances the histone acetylation of the tumor suppressor gene p53.
      This results in an accumulation of p53, p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis
      in tumor cells. HDAC, an enzyme upregulated in many tumor types, deacetylates
      chromatin histone proteins.

  LMP7 Inhibitor M3258:
    Code: C169060
    Definition: An orally bioavailable, potent, selective, reversible inhibitor of
      the large multifunctional peptidase 7 (LMP7, Beta5i, PSMB8), a chymotrypsin-like,
      proteolytic subunit of the immunoproteasome, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon oral administration, LMP7 inhibitor M3258 targets and inhibits the proteolytic
      activity of the LMP7 subunit of immunoproteasome, thereby blocking its deubiquitylating
      activity. This blocks the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway, prevents
      the degradation of defective proteins, and leads to an accumulation of poly-ubiquitylated
      proteins. This induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) and results in both
      the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor cell growth.
      Proteasomes are large multi-subunit protease complexes that degrade unneeded
      or damaged proteins that have been ubiquitinated, thereby restoring protein
      homeostasis. Unlike the constitutive proteasome, which is expressed in most
      tissues, immunoproteasome is specifically present in normal and malignant hematopoietic
      cells, including multiple myeloma. Immunoproteasome degrades ubiquitinated proteins,
      generates peptides for presentation on MHC class I, and plays a key role in
      the adaptive immune response and inflammatory diseases.

  LRP5 Antagonist BI 905681:
    Code: C171102
    Definition: An antagonist of the lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5,
      with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon administration,
      LRP5 antagonist BI 905681 targets and binds to LRP5, thereby blocking the binding
      of Wnt ligands to LRP5. This prevents the formation of the serpentine receptor
      Frizzled (FZD)-Wnt-LRP5 trimeric complex and prevents the inactivation of the
      beta-catenin degradation complex, which leads to beta-catenin degradation. This
      inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, prevents the beta-catenin-mediated
      activation of Wnt target genes, and inhibits the proliferation and survival
      of Wnt/beta-catenin-driven tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of Wnt signaling
      by BI 905681 prevents Wnt-mediated immune escape, thereby re-activating the
      immune system, specifically inducing the activation of dendritic cells (DCs)
      and activation as well as infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells into the tumor tissue.
      The FZD-Wnt-LRP5 trimeric complex induces phosphorylation of LRP5 intracellular
      domain leading to inactivation of the beta-catenin degradation complex, allowing
      beta-catenin accumulation; stabilized beta-catenin enters the nucleus and acts
      as a transcriptional activator of Wnt target genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival, and resistance to
      immunotherapy.

  LSD1 Inhibitor SYHA1807:
    Code: C173722
    Definition: An orally available inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1;
      KDM1A), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, LSD1
      inhibitor SYHA1807 targets, binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses
      the expression of target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms
      of lysine at position 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4,
      respectively. LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression
      of tumor suppressor genes. This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in
      LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated
      H3K9 which increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of
      LSD1 promotes H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. LSD1
      is overexpressed in a number of tumor cell types. LSD1 acts on histone H3 as
      a transcription co-repressor through demethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4) or as
      a transcription co-activator through demethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9).

    Code: C111906
    Definition: A targeted antibody payload (TAP)-based immunoconjugate consisting
      of a human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) conjugated, via a nonreducible thioether linker (succinimidyl
      trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate or SMCC), to the cytotoxic
      agent maytansinoid mertansine (DM1), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon intravenous administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of laprituximab
      emtansine binds to and inhibits EGFR on tumor cell surfaces. Inhibition of EGFR
      prevents EGFR-mediated signaling and may inhibit tumor cell proliferation. After
      internalization, the mertansine moiety binds to tubulin and interferes with
      microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics. This inhibits both cell division
      and the proliferation of cancer cells that express EGFR. EGFR, overexpressed
      by a variety of cancers, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.
      Linkage of the antibody and drug, through a nonreducible linker, appears to
      contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this antibody-drug
      conjugate (ADC) compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.

      to a modified Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), with potential immunomodulatory
      activity. Upon intravenous administration, the peptide moiety of letolizumab
      specifically targets and binds to CD40L expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents
      the binding of CD40L to its cognate receptor CD40 expressed on B-lymphocytes,
      macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). This prevents T-cell mediated proliferation
      and differentiation of B-cells, and prevents the production of antibodies. By
      inhibiting both the production of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies
      by B-cells and GPIIb/IIIa-dependent T-cell proliferation, letolizumab may prevent
      platelet destruction and may increase platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic
      purpura (ITP). The direct binding of letolizumab to CD40L on platelets further
      prevents CD40L/CD40-mediated destruction by macrophages and DCs in ITP. The
      modified Fc domain prevents the binding of letolizumab to the Fc receptor FcgammaRIIA
      on platelets, thereby preventing FcgammaRIIA-dependent platelet activation and
      anti-CD40L-induced thromboembolism. CD40L, a transmembrane protein of the tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, is primarily expressed on activated T-cells,

      tumor tissue, cultured in vitro with high-dose interleukin-2 (lL-2), further
      selected based on antigen specificity and tumor reactivity, and the selected
      TILs are subsequently expanded. Upon re-introduction of lifileucel into the
      patient, the TILs re-infiltrate the tumor, specifically recognize the tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs), and initiate tumor cell lysis. IL-2 induces the proliferation
      and expansion of TILs in vitro.

    Code: C124995
    Definition: An inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) and
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Lifirafenib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of BRAF and certain
      BRAF mutant forms, and EGFR. This prevents BRAF- and EGFR-mediated signaling
      and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells that either contain a mutated
      BRAF gene or express over-activated EGFR. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits mutant
      forms of the Ras proteins K-RAS and N-RAS. BRAF and EGFR are mutated or upregulated
      in many tumor cell types.

      activity. Upon oral administration linperlisib selectively binds to and inhibits
      PI3K-delta and prevents the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This
      decreases proliferation of and induces cell death in PI3K-delta over-expressing
      tumor cells. PI3K-delta also plays a key role in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling
      pathway and the proliferation of certain hematologic cancer cells. The targeted
      inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic
      cells, thereby minimizing serious side effects.

      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular

  Lumretuzumab:
    Code: C104058
    Definition: An immunoconjugate containing a glycoengineered, humanized monoclonal
      antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER3 (ErbB3),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration,  lumretuzumab binds
      to the extracellular domain of HER3 and inhibits HER3 dimerization; thereby,
      preventing EGFR-dependent signaling. In addition, RO5479599 stimulates the immune
      system to exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This may decrease
      proliferation of HER3-overexpressing tumor cells. HER3, a member of the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently
      overexpressed in tumors; it has no active kinase domain but is activated through
      heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family, such as HER2.

      cell types and on various immune cells but is minimally expressed by normal
      human tissues. B7-H3 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation; its overexpression
      plays a key role in immuno-evasion, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and
      is correlated with poor prognosis.

  Magrolimab:
    Code: C117730
    Definition: A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the human cell surface antigen
      CD47, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      magrolimab selectively binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells and blocks the
      interaction of CD47 with its ligand signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa),
      a protein expressed on phagocytic cells. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling,
      allows the activation of macrophages, through the induction of pro-phagocytic
      signaling mediated by calreticulin, which is specifically expressed on the surface
      of tumor cells, and results in specific tumor cell phagocytosis. In addition,
      blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response
      and T-mediated cell killing. CD47, a tumor associated antigen expressed on normal,
      healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), is overexpressed on the surface of a
      variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and interaction with SIRP-alpha,
      leads to inhibition of macrophages and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis
      thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate.

      reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing
      tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding
      to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.
      PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed

    Code: C121538
    Definition: A human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against
      the cell surface receptor CD40 with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon intratumoral administration, mitazalimab binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting
      dendritic cells, which leads to the activation and proliferation of effector
      and memory T-cells, and enhances the immune response against tumor cells. In
      addition, this agent binds to the CD40 antigen present on the surfaces of tumor
      cells, which induces antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). This eventually
      inhibits the proliferation of CD40-expressing tumor cells. CD40, a stimulatory
      receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily,
      is expressed on various immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and

      alfa specifically targets and binds to CD38 on CD38-positive tumor cells. In
      turn, the IFNa moiety binds to cell-surface IFN receptors, and activates IFN-mediated
      signal transduction pathways, which results in the transcription and translation
      of genes whose products may cause antiproliferative effects in CD38-positive
      tumor cells. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is present on various
      immune cells and hematologic malignancies, and its expression has been correlated
      with poor prognosis.

    Definition: An inhibitor of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein
      (myeloid cell leukemia-1; Mcl-1; Bcl2-L-3), with potential pro-apoptotic and
      antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, MCL-1 inhibitor AMG 397 targets
      and binds to Mcl-1, thereby preventing the binding of Mcl-1 to and inactivation
      of certain pro-apoptotic proteins. This promotes apoptosis of cells overexpressing
      Mcl-1. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
      family of proteins, is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell survival.

  Muscadine Grape Extract:
    Code: C175526
    Definition: An extract derived from the Muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia),
      with potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-lipidemic and chemopreventive
      activities. The muscadine grape extract (MGE) contains numerous phytochemicals
      including hydrolyzable tannins and flavonoids, such as resveratrol, anthocyanin
      3,5-diglucosides, quercetin, ellagic acid, myricetin, and kaempferol glycosides.
      Upon administration, the active components in the MGE scavenge free radicals,
      protect against oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and inhibit cell
      damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). This inhibits oxidative stress
      and protects against DNA damage. MGE also inhibits enzymes involved in inflammation,
      cell replication and DNA synthesis, and induces the expression of anti-oxidant
      enzymes. The active ingredients may also inhibit certain signaling pathways
      upregulated in some tumor cell types, eventually leading to apoptosis and a
      reduction in tumor cell proliferation. MGE may also boost energy and prevent
      fatigue.

    Definition: A recombinant form of a human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha
      (MIP1-alpha) with a substitution of aspartate to alanine at position 26, with
      potential immunomodulating and radiotherapy potentiating activity. Intravenous
      administration of nagrestipen after local tumor irradiation enhances the anti-tumor
      effect of ionizing radiation at the irradiated site as well as the antitumor
      effect at non-irradiated tumor sites (known as the abscopal effect). The abscopal
      effect appears to be attributed to this agent\'s ability to recruit and activate
      leukocytes, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes,
      thereby initiating an anti-tumor immune response against cancer cells. MIP1-alpha,
      also known as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, is a ligand for the chemokine

      maleimide-derived thioether-based linker SMCC to the maytansinoid DM1, with
      potential pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic activities. Upon administration of naratuximab
      emtansine, the antibody moiety of IMGN529 binds to CD37 on tumor B-cells and
      induces an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent
      cytotoxicity (CDC), thereby showing pro-apoptotic activity. In addition, after
      the internalization of this agent and lysosomal degradation, the DM1 moiety
      binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly,
      resulting in a disruption of microtubule activity and cell division, and eventually
      causing cell death in CD37-positive B-cells. CD37, a transmembrane glycoprotein,
      is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Compared to reducible, cleavable linkers,
      the non-reducible SMCC linker shows increased stability in plasma.

    Definition: A bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against both the Notch ligand
      delta-like 4 (DLL4) and the human tyrosine kinase vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities.
      The anti-DLL4 moiety of navicixizumab specifically binds to DLL4, prevents its
      interaction with Notch receptors, and inhibits Notch-mediated signaling and
      gene transcription, which may both block tumor angiogenesis and inhibit tumor
      cell growth. The anti-VEGF moiety binds to VEGF and prevents the binding of
      VEGF to its receptor, which blocks VEGF-mediated signaling and further inhibits
      the growth and maintenance of tumor blood vessels. The expression of DLL4 is
      highly restricted to the vascular endothelium; DLL4/Notch signaling is required
      for the development of functional tumor blood vessels. The expression of the
      pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF is associated with tumor angiogenesis and
      tumor cell proliferation and invasion.

      (IL-15Ra) Fc fusion protein (IL-15Ra-Fc) (IL-15N72D/IL-15Ra-Fc), with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, superagonist interleukin-15:interleukin-15
      receptor alphaSu/Fc fusion complex N-803 binds to the IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta-common
      gamma chain (IL-2Rbetagamma) receptor on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T lymphocytes,
      which activates and increases the levels of NK cells and memory CD8+(CD44high)
      T-cells. The memory T-cells enhance the secretion of the cytokine interferon-gamma
      (IFN-g), which further potentiates the immune response against tumor cells.
      This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation.
      IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation.
      By coupling IL-15 to IL15Ra-Fc, this agent has a prolonged drug half-life and
      shows an increased ability to bind IL-2Rbetagamma, which enhances its immune
      stimulatory activity as compared to IL-15 alone.

    Definition: A sulfated polysaccharide low-molecular-weight fucoidan, with potential
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic
      activities. Upon administration of oligo-fucoidan, this agent seems to exert
      numerous effects through various mechanisms of action, some of which remain
      to be fully elucidated. Oligo-fucoidan induces cell cycle arrest, activates
      caspases, induces apoptosis, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible
      tumor cells. It also increases the expression of tumor suppressors, such as
      p53, while decreasing levels of certain tumor promoters. Oligo-fucoidan also
      promotes the degradation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) receptor
      and the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It prevents tumor
      progression, alters tumor microenvironment (TME) and decreases the tumor-promoting
      M2 macrophages in the TME. Oligo-fucoidan has anti-inflammatory effects that
      suppress the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
      and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and decrease the production
      of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNFa). This agent may also suppress angiogenic
      activity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor expression
      and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. As an antioxidant, this agent
      protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide radicals and
      induces the expression of the anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
      factor 2 and that of its target gene, superoxide dismutase; and prevents reactive
      oxidative species (ROS) generation in cancer cells and ROS release into the

      with potential bioluminescent and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      light-emitting oncolytic vaccinia virus GL-ONC1 specifically enters tumor cells
      due to the permeable nature of the tumor vasculature. Once inside the cell,
      the virus replicates, resulting in tumor cell lysis and the release of mature
      viral particles into the tumor microenvironment. Released viral particles may
      then infect and destroy neighboring tumor cells. In addition, the release of
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by lysed tumor cells into the bloodstream may
      activate the immune system to mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response
      against the tumor. The expression of RUC-GFP by this agent allows for both detection

  Oncolytic Adenovirus ORCA-010:
    Code: C168607
    Definition: A replication competent, oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) that
      has been modified with a delta24 (d24) deletion, an incorporation of an RGD-4C
      motif in the Ad fiber protein, and an insertion of the T1 mutation in E3/19K
      gene, with potential oncolytic activity. Upon administration, oncolytic adenovirus
      ORCA-010 binds to specific Ad3 receptors that are highly expressed on certain
      tumor cells. This results in the replication of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-delta24
      in tumor cells and induces tumor cell lysis which may potentially result in
      the activation of a systemic immune response against tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs). The Ad5/3-delta24 has a 24 base pair deletion in constant region 2 of
      the E1A gene which allows for selective replication in cells that are defective
      in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A
      or p16INK4a). As most tumor cells are defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, this
      virus selectively replicates in these cells. The RGD-4C motif is a 9-amino acid
      peptide that binds to various and enhances viral-cell receptor binding by allowing
      for a Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent infection of tumor cells,
      which is the natural route of viral binding, as CAR expression is often deficient
      on cancer cells. As integrins are often overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces,
      integrin receptor binding enhances tumor cells binding and infection by the
      Ad. The T1 mutation enhances the Ad5 release from tumor cells and promotes spreading
      throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity. The T1 mutation,
      a single Adenine insertion at position 445 of the nucleotide sequence of the
      E3/19K gene of Adenovirus, creates a truncated E3/19K protein that is relocated
      to the plasma membrane due to the disruption of its ER retention signal. This
      increases plasma membrane permeability and enhances the release of Ad5.

  Oncolytic HSV-1 Expressing IL-12 and Anti-PD-1 Antibody T3011:
    Code: C175473
    Definition: A genetically engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV-1)
      expressing the human immunostimulating cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) and an
      antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor
      programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), with potential immune
      checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral administration,
      oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 infects and replicates
      in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles,
      in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released
      from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific
      systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby
      non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1
      antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the
      tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces
      both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response
      against the tumor cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death
      and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Anti-PD-1 antibody targets,
      binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore
      immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune
      responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin
      superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that
      negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated
      by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays
      an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

      oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, with potential
      oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. In ONCR-177, a dual
      bidirectional promoter enables the expression of five different transgenes:
      the natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell activating cytokine interleuin-12 (IL-12),
      the chemokines C-C motif chemokine 4 (CCL4) and the extracellular domain of
      the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG), to allow for expansion and
      recruitment of classical dendritic cells (DCs), and antagonists to the immune
      checkpoints programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to counter T cell exhaustion. Upon intra-tumoral administration,
      the oncolytic HSV-1 ONCR-177 specifically targets, infects and selectively replicates
      in tumor cells only while not infecting normal, healthy cells. This induces
      tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles then infect and replicate in
      neighboring tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. The released tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells activate the immune system to exert an
      anti-tumor immune response against the tumor cells, thereby further killing
      the tumor cells. In addition, the expressed transgenes that are released upon
      tumor cell lysis induce a systemic tumor-specific immune response and activate
      NKs, DCs and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) while inhibiting regulatory T-cells
      (Tregs). This further kills nearby non-infected tumor cells. In ONCR-177, the
      neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 allows for potent oncolysis, even in the presence
      of host cell antiviral responses. To ensure selective replication and oncolysis
      in cancer cells while attenuating replication in healthy tissue, tissue specific
      miRNA-binding cassettes (miR-T) are inserted into early genes essential for
      viral replication. In addition, UL37 mutation suppresses latent infection.'

      cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1),
      expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and the specific
      phagocytosis of tumor cells. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP),
      is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells.
      Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition
      of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, thereby
      allowing cancer cells to proliferate.

      Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) encoding multiple, as of
      yet undisclosed, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), with potential immunostimulatory
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, opolimogene
      capmilisbac is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic
      cells (DCs). The TAAs are subsequently expressed by the APCs and then processed
      and presented to the immune system by both major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC) class I and II molecules. This activates the immune system and leads to
      the recruitment and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against the
      TAA-expressing tumor cells, eventually resulting in tumor cell lysis. Two genes
      contributing to the virulence of Lm have been removed to minimize the risk of
      infection.

      CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, opucolimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking
      its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1;
      cluster of differentiation 279; CD279). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused
      by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed
      by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses
      the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein
      belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on activated T-cells,
      is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival
      of CD8-positive T-cells.

  PD-L1 Inhibitor GS-4224:
    Code: C170900
    Definition: An orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the immunosuppressive
      ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274;
      CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, anti-viral and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, PD-L1 inhibitor GS-4224 specifically targets
      PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells preventing the binding and subsequent activation
      of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1).
      This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-L1/PD-1 signaling, increases
      T-cell expansion and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor
      immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. It may also enhance hepatitis
      B virus (HBV)-specific CD8+ T-cell function, thereby killing HBV-infected cells.
      PD-L1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is overexpressed
      in some cancer types and plays a significant role in immune evasion by tumor
      cells. It is also upregulated in HBV-positive patients and contributes to immune
      dysfunction against HBV infection.

  PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA Trispecific Fusion Protein NM21-1480:
    Code: C174020
    Definition: A recombinant, trispecific monovalent antibody-based molecule targeting
      the human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor
      receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9) and human serum albumin (HSA), with
      potential checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.
      PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 consists of three monovalent
      antibody Fvs specific for PD-L1, HSA and 4-1BB fused in a single chain. Upon
      administration, PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 simultaneously
      targets and binds to a membrane-distal epitope of 4-1BB, which is expressed
      on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1
      expressed on tumor cells. The simultaneous binding to PD-L1 enables clustering
      of 4-1BB and thereby allows for conditional stimulation of 4-1BB signaling in
      the tumor microenvironment (TME) only upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells.
      4-1BB activation results in T-cell stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated
      anti-tumor activity. At the same time, NM21-1480 prevents PD-L1 from binding
      to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279;
      programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific
      T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which
      may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated
      T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses
      the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein
      of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory
      receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic
      activity. HSA fusion prolongs the half-life of NM21-1480. The conditional activation
      of 4-1BB signaling prevents systemic T-cell activation and lowers toxicity.

  PPAR Alpha Antagonist TPST-1120:
    Code: C169105
    Definition: An orally bioavailable, small molecule, selective and competitive
      antagonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa), with
      potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,
      TPST-1120 targets, binds to and blocks the activity of PPARa, thereby blocking
      transcription of PPARa target genes leading to an intracellular metabolism shift
      from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to glycolysis in FAO-dependent tumors and reducing
      the production of fatty acids in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As fatty
      acids are essential for tumor cell growth in FAO-dependent tumor cells and are
      needed for the metabolism of suppressive immune cells in the TME, including
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs), reducing the amount of fatty acids leads to a direct
      killing of FAO-dependent tumor cells. It also skews macrophages from the immune
      suppressive M2 phenotype to an effector M1 phenotype and facilitates the cytotoxicity
      of immune effector cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor immune response
      and further killing tumor cells. TPST-1120 also restores the natural inhibitor
      of angiogenesis thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and stimulator of interferon genes
      (STING) in the TME. PPARa, a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor and
      metabolic checkpoint, regulates the expression of FAO genes and lipid metabolism.
      It plays a key role in immunosuppression in the TME. FAO is a metabolic pathway
      essential to tumor growth, survival and immunosuppression.

  Pacmilimab:
    Code: C132192
    Definition: A recombinant antibody prodrug composed of a monoclonal antibody directed
      against the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
      (PD-L1; B7-H1; CD274) that is linked to a proprietary masking peptide through
      a protease-cleavable linker on the amino terminus of the light chain domain
      of the antibody, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration of pacmilimab, the linkage system is stable
      in the circulation and, upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment,
      the peptide mask is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases. These proteases are
      present in high concentrations and aberrantly activated in the tumor microenvironment,
      while expressed as inactive forms, at much lower concentrations, in normal,
      healthy tissue. Protease cleavage of the linker enables binding of the unmasked,
      fully active monoclonal antibody moiety of CX-072 to PD-L1, which is over expressed
      on certain cancer cells. This blocks the binding to and activation of its receptor
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes, thereby enhancing the T-cell-mediated
      anti-tumor immune response and reversing PD-L1/PD-1-mediated T-cell suppression.
      PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in
      immune evasion. Compared to the unmodified PD-L1 antibody, peptide masking of
      CX-072 minimizes binding to PD-L1 in normal tissues, thereby decreasing autoimmune-based
      side effects while retaining anti-tumor activity.

      binds to CTGF thereby preventing the binding of the ligand to the receptor and
      subsequent receptor activation. As CTGF enhances the production of collagen
      and fibronectin, FG-319 may prevent and reverse fibrosis. In addition, FG-3019

  Pan-KRAS Inhibitor BI 1701963:
    Code: C166138
    Definition: An orally available protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor that
      targets the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, pan-KRAS inhibitor
      BI 1701963 selectively targets and binds to SOS1, thereby preventing the interaction
      of SOS1 with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) in the guanosine
      diphosphate (GDP)-bound \'off\' state, which is the inactivated state of KRAS.
      This abrogates the exchange of RAS-bound GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
      and prevents the formation of GTP-loaded KRAS, which is the activated \'on\'
      state of KRAS. This prevents activation of downstream RAF/mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling
      pathway by GTP-loaded KRAS. This inhibits mutant KRAS-dependent signaling and
      may inhibit growth and survival of KRAS-expressing tumor cells. KRAS is a member
      of the RAS family of oncogenes that is mutated in many cancer cell types. Mutations
      of KRAS may induce constitutive signal transduction leading to tumor cell proliferation,
      survival, invasion, and metastasis. SOS1 regulates the KRAS GDP-GTP cycle and
      promotes nucleotide exchange and formation of \'active\' KRAS-GTP.

      receptor kinase; TRK) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon
      oral administration, pan-TRK inhibitor NOV1601 specifically targets and binds
      to TRK, TRK mutations and fusion proteins containing sequences from neurotrophic
      tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) types 1 (NTRK1; TrkA), 2 (NTRK2; TrkB), and
      3 (NTRK3; TrkC). This inhibits neurotrophin-TRK interaction and TRK activation,
      thereby preventing the activation of downstream signaling pathways and resulting
      in both the induction of cellular apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth
      in tumors that overexpress TRK and/or express NTRK fusion proteins. TRK, a family
      of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activated by neurotrophins, is encoded by
      NTRK family genes. The expression of either mutated forms of, or fusion proteins
      involving, NTRK family members results in uncontrolled TRK signaling, which
      plays an important role in tumor cell growth, survival, invasion and treatment
      resistance.

  Pan-mutation-selective EGFR Inhibitor CLN-081:
    Code: C165567
    Definition: An orally available selective inhibitor of a broad spectrum of epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations
      (EGFR Ex20ins; Ex20ins mutations), with potential antineoplastic activity. CLN-081
      is also active against other EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions (exon19del),
      L858R, and T790M, as well as the less common G719X, L861Q and S768I mutations.
      Upon administration, the pan-mutation-selective EGFR inhibitor CLN-081 specifically
      and covalently binds to and inhibits a variety of EGFR mutations, with particularly
      high selectivity against EGFR Ex20ins, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling
      and leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some
      other EGFR inhibitors, CLN-081 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with
      EGFR Ex20ins, as most EGFR mutant-selective inhibitors are not active against
      EGFR Ex20ins. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR (wt EGFR),
      and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities that occur during the use of non-selective
      EGFR inhibitors, which also inhibit wt EGFR. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase
      mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation
      and tumor vascularization.

      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1)
      and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), with potential anti-angiogenic and
      antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, panulisib inhibits the
      activity of all four kinases. This prevents PI3K/mTOR and ALK-1-mediated signaling
      pathways and may lead to the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K/mTOR-overexpressing
      tumor cells and angiogenesis in ALK-1-overexpressing endothelial cells. Also,
      by inhibiting DNA-PK, this agent inhibits the ability of tumor cells to repair
      damaged DNA. The PI3K/mTOR pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and
      plays an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and
      survival. ALK-1, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) type
      I receptor family, is overexpressed on endothelial cells in a variety of tumor
      types and increases endothelial cell proliferation and migration. DNA-PK is

      penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into the tumor bed. HA is a glycosaminoglycan
      found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) that is frequently overproduced by various
      tumor cell types. The presence of HA in tumors correlates with increased tumor
      cell growth, metastatic potential, tumor progression, increased resistance to
      chemotherapeutic agents, and an elevation in tumor IFP.

      pelabresib binds to the acetylated lysine recognition motifs on the bromodomain
      of BET proteins, thereby preventing the interaction between the BET proteins
      and acetylated histone peptides. This disrupts chromatin remodeling and gene
      expression. Prevention of the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may
      lead to an inhibition of tumor cell growth. Characterized by a tandem repeat
      of two bromodomains at the N-terminus, the BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and

      with potential antineoplastic activity, and potential sensitizing and enhancing
      activities for both chemo- and radiotherapies. Upon administration, peposertib
      binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA-PK, thereby interfering with the non-homologous
      end joining (NHEJ) process and preventing repair of DNA double strand breaks
      (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases
      chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity and leads to enhanced tumor cell death.
      The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the

  Pimitespib:
    Code: C134448
    Definition: A specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) subtypes alpha
      and beta, with potential antineoplastic and chemo/radiosensitizing activities.
      Upon oral administration, pimitespib specifically binds to and inhibits the
      activity of Hsp90 alpha and beta; this results in the proteasomal degradation
      of oncogenic client proteins, which inhibits client protein dependent-signaling,
      induces apoptosis, and inhibits the proliferation of cells overexpressing HSP90alpha/beta.
      Hsp90, a family of molecular chaperone proteins that are upregulated in a variety
      of tumor cells, plays a key role in the conformational maturation, stability,
      and function of \"client\" proteins within the cell,; many of which are involved
      in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including kinases,
      cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors and hormone receptors. As TAS-116
      selectively inhibits cytosolic HSP90alpha and beta only and does not inhibit
      HSP90 paralogs, such as endoplasmic reticulum GRP94 or mitochondrial TRAP1,

    Definition: A long-acting formulation composed of the human cytokine interleukin-15
      (IL-15) that is conjugated by polymers, with potential immunomodulating and
      anti-tumor activities. Upon administration of polymer-conjugated IL-15 receptor
      agonist NKTR-255, the IL-15 moiety targets and binds to the alpha subunit of
      the IL-15 receptor on natural killer (NK) and T-cells, thereby activating the
      IL-15-mediated pathway. This leads to the expansion and activation of natural
      killer (NK) cells and memory CD8+ T-cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor
      activity of NKs and long-term memory T-lymphocyte immune responses. This may
      increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. In addition,
      NKTR-255 may, when combined with a tumor-directed antibody, enhance the antibody-dependent
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine
      that plays a key role in the regulation of T- and NK cell activation, proliferation
      and promotion of their anti-tumor effects. Compared to IL-15 alone, the polymer
      formulation allows for increased retention at the tumor site and reduced clearance,

  Pseudomyxoma peritonei with unknown primary site:

    Definition: A usually well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the peritoneum.  The

      of the appendix.  Cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei associated with mucinous adenocarcinomas
      of the gallbladder, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, breast, and fallopian
      tubes have also been reported.  In the past, the ovary has been considered as
      a common primary site associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei.  However, there
      is recent evidence based on immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic analysis
      suggesting that most cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei probably represent metastasis
      from an appendiceal and not ovarian primary.

    Definition: An orally bioavailable activator of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2),
      with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,
      PKM2 activator TP-1454 locks PKM2 into the active tetrameric form. This may
      prevent the production of glycolytic intermediates by the less active dimer
      form of PKM2, depleting the supply of glycolytic intermediates which are needed
      for tumor cell growth. This may also inhibit immune suppression mediated by
      the dimer form of PKM2. Altogether, this may slow tumor cell growth and enhance
      anti-tumor immune responses, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. PKM2,
      the predominant PK isoform found in tumor cells, is responsible for catalyzing
      the last step of glycolysis. PKM2 plays a critical role in the metabolic changes
      observed in cancer and immune cells and establishes a metabolic advantage for
      tumor cells over the tumor immune microenvironment.

    Definition: An orally bioavailable selective dual inhibitor of fusions and mutations
      involving the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transfection
      (ret) and the src family tyrosine kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon oral administration, the RET/SRC inhibitor TPX-0046 specifically targets
      and binds to ret mutants and ret-containing fusion products. This results in
      an inhibition of cell growth of tumor cells that exhibit increased ret activity.
      By inhibiting src kinase-mediated signaling and reducing the src-initiated recruitment
      of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases involved in bypass resistance, TPX-0046
      may be able to overcome tumor resistance which may increase its therapeutic
      effect. Ret overexpression, activating mutations, and fusions result in the
      upregulation and/or overactivation of ret tyrosine kinase activity in various
      cancer cell types; dysregulation of ret activity plays a key role in the development
      and progression of these cancers. Src tyrosine kinases are upregulated in many

  Racemetyrosine/Methoxsalen/Phenytoin/Sirolimus SM-88:
    Code: C124051
    Definition: A combination agent containing racemetyrosine, methoxsalen, phenytoin
      and sirolimus, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of
      racemetyrosine/methoxsalen/phenytoin/sirolimus SM-88, racemetyrosine, being
      a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential amino acid tyrosine,
      is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter L-amino acid
      transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty amino acid protein
      building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis in cancer cells. Specifically,
      this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis. MUC1 is highly overexpressed
      by most cancer cells and regulates the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism that cancer cells utilize,
      by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing ROS-mediated apoptosis.
      In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading to an increase in
      oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being a protective transmembrane
      protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on the outside of cancer cells
      and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell from the immune system. The
      loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby making the cancer cell more
      vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the immune system. Rapamycin, a
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, increases the cancer cells\'
      need for tyrosine uptake and increases the uptake of racemetyrosine by LAT1.
      Phenytoin stimulates the release of reactive lipid species by the liver which
      accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are taken up by cancer cells,
      thereby further increasing ROS within the cancer cell and increasing oxidative-related
      apoptosis. Mehoxsalen promotes toxic electron transfer and increases melanin,
      increases oxidative reactions and production of ROS. This further stimulates
      oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Normal cells do not regularly take up certain
      non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, but readily convert phenylalanine
      to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not expected to consume racemetyrosine.

    Definition: An anti-human glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor
      (tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 18; TNFRSF18; GITR; CD357) agonistic
      humanized monoclonal antibody, with potential immune checkpoint modulating activity.
      Ragifilimab binds to and activates GITRs found on multiple types of T-cells.
      This stimulates the immune system, induces both the activation and proliferation
      of tumor-antigen-specific T effector cells (Teff), and suppresses the function
      of activated T regulatory cells (Tregs). This leads to tumor cell eradication.
      GITR, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and T-cell receptor co-stimulator,
      is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cell types, including Tregs,
      Teffs, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Inappropriately activated Tregs
      suppress Teffs and suppress T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling.

      derived from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, genetically engineered to be
      produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration of recombinant Erwinia asparaginase JZP-458, the recombinant
      asparaginase hydrolyzes L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid and ammonia. This depletes
      cancer cells of asparagine, which blocks protein synthesis and tumor cell proliferation.
      Asparagine is critical to protein synthesis in cancer cells, which cannot synthesize
      this amino acid due to the absence of the enzyme asparagine synthase. JZP-458
      can be used as an alternative in patients who are hypersensitive to Escherichia

  Recombinant Human TRAIL-Trimer Fusion Protein SCB-313:
    Code: C170907
    Definition: A recombinant fusion protein composed of the human C-propeptide of
      alpha1(I) collagen (Trimer-Tag) to the C-terminus of the mature human tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; Apo2L), with
      potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. The binding of TRAIL
      to the Trimer-Tag allows TRAIL to form a stable covalently-linked homotrimer.
      Upon administration of recombinant human TRAIL-trimer fusion protein SCB-313,
      this fusion protein targets, binds to and trimerizes the TRAIL-receptors, pro-apoptotic
      death receptors (DRs) TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4; DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (death receptor
      5; DR5), expressed on tumor cells, thereby activating caspases and inducing
      apoptosis in TRAIL-R1/R2-expressing tumor cells. TRAIL, a homotrimeric type
      II transmembrane protein and member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines, plays
      a key role in the induction of apoptosis through TRAIL-mediated death receptor
      pathways. The pro-apoptotic cell surface receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2, members
      of the TNF receptor family, are overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types;
      The induction of receptor trimerization is needed for the initiation of the
      apoptotic signaling pathway. The TRAIL-Trimer retains similar bioactivity and
      receptor binding kinetics as native TRAIL but has more favorable pharmacokinetics
      and antitumor activity than native TRAIL.

      extracellular dimerization (ECD) domain of the tumor-associated antigen (TAA)
      human tyrosine kinase receptor epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ErbB2;
      HER-2), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, recombinant humanized anti-HER-2 bispecific monoclonal antibody
      MBS301 simultaneously targets and binds to two separate, non-overlapping epitopes
      of HER-2. This prevents the activation of HER-2 signaling pathways. Also, by
      binding to HER-2, MBS301 induces an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
      (ADCC) against tumor cells that overexpress HER-2. This results in tumor cell
      apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing tumor
      cells. HER-2, overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types, plays an important
      role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.

      cells in the bone marrow and an increased number of myeloblasts in the peripheral
      blood.  The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used
      to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the
      term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic
      syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required
      for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination
      of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently,
      according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best
      classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following
      myelodysplastic syndrome).  A minority of cases are part of RAEB-2.

      and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane
      protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions
      as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector
      function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

    Definition: An N-acetylated, glycol-split form of heparin that is devoid of anticoagulant
      activity and is an inhibitor of heparanase with antineoplastic and antiangiogenic
      activities. Upon subcutaneous administration, roneparstat inhibits the activity
      of heparanase. This prevents the heparanase-mediated cleavage of heparan sulfate
      (HS) proteoglycans on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix. In
      addition, this agent prevents the heparanase-induced production of a number
      of angiogenic growth factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-9, hepatocyte
      growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Altogether, this leads
      to an inhibition of both tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. Heparanase, an

      2b (IFN-a2b), in which IFN-a2b is coupled, via proline, to polyethylene glycol
      (PEG), with antiviral, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, IFN-a2b targets and binds to specific
      IFN cell-surface receptors. This activates IFN-mediated signal transduction
      pathways and induces the transcription and translation of genes with IFN-specific
      response elements (ISREs). Their protein products mediate antiviral, antiproliferative,
      anticancer, and immune-modulating effects. The PEG moiety inhibits proteolytic
      breakdown and clearance of IFN-a2b, which prolongs its half-life, extends the
      duration of its therapeutic effects and allows less frequent dosing. The proline
      linker facilitates the synthesis of a single positional isomer which further
      increases its stability and half-life.

      immunostimulating and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral
      injection of the ropocamptide, this peptide increases p53 expression, and induces
      phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrest and
      caspase-independent apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)/ endonuclease G (EndoG)-mediated
      apoptotic cell death in susceptible cancer cells. This suppresses tumor cell
      proliferation.  LL-37, a protein secreted by bone marrow cells, circulating

  SIRPa-4-1BBL Fusion Protein DSP107:
    Code: C174171
    Definition: A bi-functional, trimeric, fusion protein consisting of the extracellular
      domains (ECDs) of human signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha; SIRPa; CD172a)
      fused to a 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory,
      immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the SIRPa-4-1BBL
      fusion protein DSP107 selectively targets and binds to both CD47 expressed on
      tumor cells and 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member
      9; TNFRSF9) expressed on T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Binding to CD47
      blocks the interaction of CD47 with endogenous SIRPa, a cell surface protein
      expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling and abrogates
      the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis
      of cancer cells. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding
      of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor
      cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1),
      which is expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and
      the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. The binding of 4-1BBL to 4-1BB activates
      4-1BB-mediated signaling, induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation,
      cytokine production and promotes a CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response as
      well as NK-mediated tumor cell killing. The crosslinking specifically enables
      the activation of 4-1BB-mediated signaling in T-cells and NK cells in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), allowing targeted immune responses in the TME. CD47,
      also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer
      cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate. 4-1BB,
      a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is
      an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation,
      survival and cytolytic activity.

  SIRPa-Fc-CD40L Fusion Protein SL-172154:
    Code: C173706
    Definition: A bi-functional fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains
      (ECDs) of human signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha; SIRPa; CD172a) and
      CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154; TRAP; TNFSF5) linked via a human Fc domain, with
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      the SIRPa-Fc-CD40L fusion protein SL-172154 selectively targets and binds to
      both CD47 expressed on tumor cells and CD40, a cell surface receptor that belongs
      to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, expressed on antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs). Binding to CD47 blocks the interaction of CD47 with endogenous
      SIRPa, a cell surface protein expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated
      signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of macrophage activation
      and phagocytosis of cancer cells. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated
      by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the
      surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1
      (LRP-1), which is expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation
      and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. The binding of CD40L to CD40 activates
      CD40, increases CD40-mediated signaling and induces proliferation and activation
      of B-lymphocytes, shifts the induction of suppressive macrophages towards immunostimulatory
      macrophages, activates monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), and leads to
      the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This activates the immune system to
      induce the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against
      tumor cells. The crosslinking specifically enhances antigen presentation to
      CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and tumor cell phagocytosis by the APC. CD47, also
      called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA)
      expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction

      oral administration, SRPK1/ABCG2 inhibitor SCO-101 targets, binds to and inhibits
      the activity of SRPK1 and ABCG2. Inhibition of the cellular efflux pump ABCG2
      by SCO-101 prevents the efflux of co-administered chemotherapeutic agents from

      protein 173; TMEM173), with potential immunoactivating and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon intravenous administration, STING agonist TAK-676 targets and binds to
      STING and activates the STING pathway in immune cells in the tumor microenvironment
      (TME). This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
      interferons (IFNs), enhances the cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs) by dendritic cells (DCs), and induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      immune response against cancer cells. STING, a transmembrane protein that activates
      immune cells in the TME, plays a key role in the activation of the innate immune
      system.

      activities. Upon intratumoral administration, STING-expressing E. coli SYNB1891
      are engulfed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) within the tumor. STING-mediated
      pathways within the APCs are then activated resulting in a type I interferon
      (IFN) response which promotes initiation and propagation of tumor-specific T-cell
      responses. In addition, the bacterial component of SYNB1891 may further stimulate
      the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which may enhance the
      magnitude of the overall immune response. STING, a transmembrane protein that
      activates immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a key role
      in the activation of the innate immune system.

      (EGFR) conjugated to a talirine, a cytotoxic, DNA minor groove crosslinking
      agent and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon intravenous administration of serclutamab talirine, the serclutamab moiety
      targets and binds to EGFR on tumor cell surfaces. Following receptor internalization
      and lysosome-mediated cleavage, talirine is released. In turn, the imine groups
      of the PBD moiety bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of
      DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2/M
      cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing
      tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is overexpressed by
      a variety of cancers, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.

      to the endogenous CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), sotigalimab binds to CD40 on
      a variety of immune cell types. This triggers the cellular proliferation and
      activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and activates B-cells, and effector
      and memory T-cells. This results in an enhanced immune response against tumor
      cells. Sotigalimab also binds to and activates CD40 present on the surfaces
      of some solid tumor cells, leading to apoptosis and decreased tumor growth.
      CD40, a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      receptor superfamily, is expressed on various immune cells and certain cancer
      cells; it mediates both indirect tumor cell killing through the activation of

    Definition: A rare, locally invasive neoplasm arising from tooth-forming tissues.
      It usually grows intraosseously in the mandible. The maxilla is less frequently
      involved. It is characterized by the presence of well differentiated squamous
      cells which form islands. Recurrences may rarely occur and probably are related
      to incomplete excision of the tumor.

    Definition: A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the immunosuppressive
      ligand, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation
      274; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, sugemalimab specifically targets and binds
      to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor, programmed
      cell death 1 (PD-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1
      signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor
      immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed
      by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses
      the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein
      belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells,
      is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival
      of CD8-positive T-cells. Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody CS1001 mirrors natural
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), potentially reducing immunogenicity and other toxicities.

      inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), a co-inhibitory molecule and immune
      checkpoint inhibitor, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, TIGIT inhibitor M6223 targets and binds to
      TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating
      T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands
      CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PRR2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus
      receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction
      of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1;
      DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells
      and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling
      and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against
      cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory
      receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation;
      it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral
      immune responses.

      activity. Upon oral administration, CB-839 selectively and irreversibly inhibits
      glutaminase, a mitochondrial enzyme that is essential for the conversion of
      the amino acid glutamine into glutamate. By blocking glutamine utilization,
      proliferation in rapidly growing cells is impaired. Glutamine-dependent tumors
      rely on the conversion of exogenous glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites
      to both provide energy and generate building blocks for the production of macromolecules,
      which are needed for cellular growth and survival.

    Code: C150413
    Definition: The hydrochloride salt form of CB-839, an orally bioavailable inhibitor
      of glutaminase, with potential antineoplastic and immunostimulating activities.
      Upon oral administration, CB-839 selectively and reversibly binds to and inhibits
      human glutaminase, an enzyme that is essential for the conversion of the amino
      acid glutamine into glutamate. Blocking glutamine metabolism inhibits proliferation
      in rapidly growing tumor cells and leads to an induction of cell death. Unlike
      normal healthy cells, glutamine-dependent tumors heavily rely on the intracellular
      conversion of exogenous glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites to
      both provide energy and generate building blocks for the production of macromolecules,
      which are needed for cellular growth and survival. In addition, CB-839 causes
      accumulation of glutamine in tumor cells and increases glutamine concentration
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon cell death. As glutamine is essential
      for T-cell generation, CB-839 may also enhance T-cell proliferation and activation
      in the TME, which may lead to further killing of tumor cells.

      binds to both CD3 on T-cells and CLEC12A expressed on malignant cells, such
      as myeloid blasts, atypical progenitor cells and leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
      This results in the cross-linking of T-cells with tumor cells, and induces a
      potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CLEC12A-expressing tumor
      cells. CLEC12A, a myeloid differentiation antigen and member of the C-type lectin/C-type
      lectin-like domain (CTL/CTLD) superfamily, is overexpressed on myeloid leukemia

  Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, alkylating agent related:
    Code: C7643
    Definition: A disorder seen following cancer chemotherapy. It is the most common
      cause of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes. It typically manifests several
      years after initiation of single or multi-agent chemotherapy with alkylators.
      Mutagenic potential of alkylating agents is believed to be age and cumulative
      dose-dependent. Deletions in chromosomes 5 and 7 are associated with susceptibility
      to this disorder. Clinical signs may include fatigue, dyspnea, bruising and
      frequent infections. Clinical course may progress to bone marrow failure or
      acute myeloid leukemia that is refractory to treatment. Prognosis is dismal
      with survivability usually less than one year.

      of these non-intercalating DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors is believed to be
      increased with concurrent use of asparaginase or granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor. Balanced translocations involving chromosomal bands 11q23 and 21q22
      are commonly associated with this disorder. Clinical signs may include fatigue,
      dyspnea, bruising and frequent infections. Clinical course usually progresses
      to acute myeloid leukemia though most epipodophyllotoxin-related leukemias do
      not have an antecedent myelodysplastic phase. Prognosis is dismal with survivability
      usually less than one year.

  Thymus:
    Code: C12433
    Definition: A bi-lobed organ surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. It is
      located in the upper anterior portion of the chest, behind the sternum. It is
      composed predominantly of lymphocytes and fewer epithelial cells. Connective
      tissue septa separate the lobes into lobules. The lobules contain an outer portion
      (cortical zone) which is rich in lymphocytes and an inner portion (medullary
      zone) which is rich in epithelial cells. It is an organ essential for the development
      of the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor lymphoid
      cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells. It reaches its greatest
      weight at puberty and subsequently begins to involute.

      TNFRSF10B; tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor
      2; TRAILR2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, tilogotamab
      specifically binds to and activates DR5. This results in the activation of caspase
      cascades and the induction of apoptosis in DR5-expressing tumor cells. DR5,
      a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
      (TNFRSF), is involved in the promotion of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Compared
      to other DR5 antibody-based agonists, the antibodies in GEN1029 (DR5-01 and
      DR5-05) elicit increased receptor activation because they exhibit enhanced formation
      of antibody hexamers and receptor clusters at the cell surface due to E430G

    Definition: An orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, selective, small molecule
      inhibitor of Bruton\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK), with potential immunomodulatory
      and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon oral administration, tolebrutinib is
      able to cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibits the activity of BTK both
      peripherally and in the central nervous system (CNS). This prevents the activation
      of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, and the resulting immune
      activation and inflammation. The inhibition of BTK activity also prevents microglial
      inflammatory signaling in the CNS, and the resulting immune activation, neuroinflammation
      and neurodegeneration. BTK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and member of the
      Tec family of kinases, plays an important role in B lymphocyte development,
      activation, signaling, proliferation and survival. In addition to B cells, BTK
      is also expressed in innate immune cells, including macrophages and microglia,

      an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody,
      conjugated to a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 dual agonist, with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of trastuzumab-TLR 7/8 agonist
      BDC-1001, the trastuzumab moiety targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor
      cells and, simultaneously, the TLR 7/8 dual agonist moiety targets, binds to
      and activates TLR7/8 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically
      dendritic cells (DCs), in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The trastuzumab
      binding to the tumor cells causes the engulfment of the BDC-1001-bound tumor
      cells by tumor-associated myeloid (TAM) cells and the TAMs travel to the lymph
      nodes. The DCs activated by the TLR7/8 agonist causes the activation of TLR7/8-mediated
      pathways, and stimulates the maturation and activation of DCs, thereby re-activating
      the immune system against the tumor cells. Activation of DCs results in the

  Urabrelimab:
    Code: C155976
    Definition: A human monoclonal antibody targeting the human cell surface antigen
      CD47, with potential phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, urabrelimab selectively binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks
      the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an
      inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated
      signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis.
      This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin
      (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages.
      This results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor
      cells. In addition, blocking CD47 signaling activates both an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte
      immune response and T cell-mediated killing of CD47-expressing tumor cells.
      CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects
      cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate.

      domains; T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain), with potential immune checkpoint
      inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, vibostolimab
      targets and binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on
      tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby
      preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus
      receptor related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like
      protein 5; NECL-5), which are expressed on T-cells, NK cells and certain cancer
      cells. This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory
      receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune
      cells, such as NK cells and CD8+ T-cells, and activates CD226-mediated signaling.
      This activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response
      against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family and an immune inhibitory
      receptor, is overexpressed on tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and CD8+ TILs
      and plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation;
      it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral
      immune responses.

      hyperpigmented skin areas, are present from birth and found anywhere on the
      body surface.  They can vary markedly in size and color.  The dark brown areas
      are called cafe-au-lait spots. The multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors
      are nerve sheath tumors, called neurofibromas.  They can develop anywhere along
      the peripheral nerve fibers. Neurofibromas can become quite large, causing a
      major disfigurement, eroding bone, and compressing various peripheral nerve
      structures.  Type 1 neurofibromatosis has dominant inheritance, with a gene

    Definition: An orally available inhibitor of mutated forms of both isocitrate
      dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1, IDH1 [NADP+] soluble) in the cytoplasm and type
      2 (IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP+], mitochondrial) in the mitochondria,
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, vorasidenib specifically
      inhibits mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2, thereby inhibiting the formation of
      the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG).
      This prevents 2HG-mediated signaling and leads to both an induction of cellular
      differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells expressing
      IDH mutations. In addition, vorasidenib is able to penetrate the blood-brain
      barrier (BBB). IDH1 and 2, metabolic enzymes that catalyze the conversion of
      isocitrate into a-KG, play key roles in energy production and are mutated in
      a variety of cancer cell types. In addition, mutant forms of IDH1 and 2 catalyze
      the formation of 2HG and drive cancer growth by blocking cellular differentiation
      and inducing cellular proliferation.

      activities. Upon oral administration, vosilasarm acts as an agonist in select
      tissues, such as skeletal muscle and bone, where it binds to and activates androgen
      receptors (ARs). In the prostate and breasts, RAD140 acts as an antagonist and
      blocks AR activation and AR-mediated cellular proliferation. Therefore, this
      agent may improve bone formation and muscle mass and strength, and may inhibit
      both the growth of the prostate in males and AR-dependent breast cancer cell
      proliferation. Compared to anabolic agents, SARMs have reduced androgenic properties.

  Wee1 Inhibitor ZN-c3:
    Code: C167064
    Definition: An inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase Wee1 (Wee1-like protein kinase;
      Wee1A kinase; WEE1hu) with potential antineoplastic sensitizing activity. Although
      the exact mechanism of action by which this agent inhibits Wee1 has yet to be
      disclosed, upon administration of ZN-c3, this agent targets and inhibits Wee1.
      Inhibition of Wee1 promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest
      leading to cell death in susceptible tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated
      human cancers that lack the G1 checkpoint, upon treatment with DNA-damaging
      chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated
      human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint
      and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment
      of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable
      to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect. Overexpression
      of Wee1 occurs in several cancer types and high expression of Wee1 is associated
      with poor outcomes. Wee1 phosphorylates Cdc2 in the Cdc2/cyclin B (CDK1/cyclin
      B) complex which blocks progression from G2 into mitosis; it negatively regulates
      the G2 checkpoint by disallowing entry into mitosis in response to DNA damage.

      sensitizing activity. Upon oral administration of Debio 0123, this agent targets,
      binds to and inhibits Wee1. Inhibition of Wee1 inhibits Cdk1 (Cdc2) phosphorylation,
      promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest, which results
      in the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. This leads to apoptosis in susceptible
      tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated human cancers that lack the G1
      checkpoint, especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.
      Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1
      checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells
      rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the

  Xevinapant:
    Code: C90574
    Definition: An orally available mimetic of the natural second mitochondrial-derived
      activator of caspases (Smac) and inhibitor of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins
      (IAPs), with potential immunomodulating, apoptotic-inducing, chemo-radio-sensitizing
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and
      binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor
      X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2).
      This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis.
      Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically
      with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis.
      As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives
      the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant
      may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating
      agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many
      cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding
      to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains.
      They contribute to chemo-radio-resistance of cancer cells to certain cytotoxic
      agents and radiation, promote tumor cell survival and are associated with poor
      prognosis in certain types of cancer. SMAC, a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein,
      is an endogenous inhibitor of the IAPs family of cellular proteins.

      xiliertinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated
      signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor
      growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated
      in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor
      vascularization.

  Xisomab 3G3:

      activity. Upon administration, xisomab 3G3 targets and binds to the apple 2
      domain of FXI, thereby preventing the binding of FXI to factor XIIa (FXIIa).
      This blocks factor XIIa-mediated FXI activation without inhibiting FXI activation
      by thrombin or the procoagulant function of FXIa. The abrogation of FXI activation
      prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and reduces platelet
      and fibrin accumulation. This results in the inhibition of contact activation-initiated
      blood coagulation and prevents thrombus formation. FXI contributes to thrombotic
      disease while playing a limited role in normal hemostasis. Activation of FXI
      is essential for thrombus growth and stabilization.

  Zandelisib:
    Code: C123925
    Definition: An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration,
      zandelisib selectively inhibits the delta isoform of PI3K and prevents the activation
      of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This both decreases proliferation and induces
      cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta plays a key
      role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. The targeted
      inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic
      cells. PI3K, an enzyme often overexpressed in cancer cells, plays a crucial
      role in tumor cell regulation and survival.

      antigen (TAA) epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), ECD2 and ECD4, with
      potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      zanidatamab targets and binds to the two distinct HER2 domains on the tumor
      cell surface. This results in dual HER2 signal blockade, HER2 clustering, receptor
      internalization and downregulation. This also induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL) response and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against
      tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
      (ADCP) is also induced and further stimulates the immune system to kill HER2-overexpressing
      tumor cells. The HER2 receptor internalization also further inhibits HER2 activation,
      HER2-mediated signaling and HER2-mediated tumor cell growth. HER2, a tyrosine
      kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.

      inhibiting its chaperone function and promoting the proteasomal degradation
      of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival.

      binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR as well as certain mutant forms of
      EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction
      of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR,

  Zotatifin:
    Code: C165746
    Definition: A selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
      4A (eIF4A), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of zotatifin,
      this agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with
      specific polypurine motifs within their 5\'-untranslated region (5\'-UTR), leading
      to the formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and
      mRNA (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of
      key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation,
      survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1),
      B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D,
      fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression
      of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction
      pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells.
      eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation
      initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and
      facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5\'-UTR. elF4A is activated by
      various oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates
      the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary
      structures within the 5\'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation,
      survival and metastasis.

      kinase 2 (JAK2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, FLK2, STK1), with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, CDK/JAK2/FLT3 Inhibitor TG02
      binds to and inhibits the CDK subtypes, JAK2, and FLT3. TG02 also inhibits,
      to a lesser extent, TYK2, TYRO3, STAT5 and P38delta. This may result in both
      an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in cancer
      cells that overexpress these kinases. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in
      a variety of cancer cells, mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in
      tumor cell proliferation and survival. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that
      play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation.

      killer (NK) cell product derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem
      cell (iPSC) line, and engineered to express a NK cell-specific anti-CD19 CAR,
      a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, and a recombinant
      fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15RF), with potential immunostimulatory
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, iPSC-derived CD16/IL-15RF-expressing
      Anti-CD19 CAR-NK Cells FT596 recognize, bind to and induce selective cytotoxicity
      in CD19-expressing tumor cells. IL-15RF enhances the cytotoxic effect of the
      NK cells and the activated anti-tumor T-cells. When used in combination with
      monoclonal antibodies, the hnCD16 Fc receptor of FT596 binds to the Fc portion
      of tumor cell-bound monoclonal antibodies, leading to NK cell activation, cytokine
      secretion and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD19
      antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage
      malignancies. CD16, also known as Fc-gamma receptor III, is normally expressed
      on the surface of NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, and plays
      a key role in initiating ADCC. It is often downregulated in certain cancers,
      thereby inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response.

    Definition: An orally bioavailable, selective, second-generation inhibitor of
      valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, with potential antineoplastic activity.  Upon
      oral administration, p97 inhibitor CB-5339 binds to and inhibits the activity
      of p97.  This prevents ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and causes cellular
      accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins.  The inhibition of endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation activates the ER-dependent stress
      response pathway, and leads to both an induction of apoptosis and the inhibition
      of cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells.  VCP/p97, a type II AAA+ ATPase,
      plays a key role in cellular protein homeostasis processes including ER-associated
      degradation (ERAD), chromatin associated degradation (CAD) and the DNA damage
      response (DDR).  Its overexpression in many tumor cell types is associated with
      increased tumor cell proliferation and survival.

      to human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6, E7, and L2 proteins, with potential
      immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration via intramuscular
      injection with electroporation, the pNGVL4a-CRT-E6E7L2 DNA vaccine expresses
      HPV16 E6, E7 and L2 proteins, which may elicit a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)
      response and humoral immune responses against tumor cells expressing these proteins,
      resulting in tumor cell lysis and tumor cell death. In addition, HPV16 L2-specific
      neutralizing antibody may prevent a broad spectrum of HPV infections and HPV-associated
      cancers. The heat shock protein CRT may potentiate MHC class I presentation
      to antigen-specific CD8-positive T-cells, enhancing the induction of cellular
      immunity and the potency of the vaccine.

      pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine and a boost HPV16 L2/E6/E7 fusion protein
      TA-CIN vaccine, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.
      pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine is an antigen-specific DNA cancer vaccine
      consisting of the coding sequences of a signal peptide (pNGVL4a-Sig), a detox
      form of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) antigen E7, and the heat shock
      protein 70 (HSP70). Upon administration, this prime vaccine may generate potent
      cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses against E7-expressing tumor cells, resulting
      in tumor cell death. HPV16 L2/E6/E7 fusion protein TA-CIN vaccine is a recombinant
      human papillomavirus (HPV), genetically engineered fusion protein vaccine in
      which the three HPV16 viral proteins L2, E6 and E7 are fused together in a single
      tandem fusion protein (TA-CIN; HPV16 L2\E6\E7). Upon administration, this boost
      vaccine may stimulate the immune system to generate HPV16 E6\E7-specific CD4+
      and CD8+ T-cell responses as well as the induction of L2-specific antibodies.
      In addition, this vaccine may prevent infection and the development of other
      HPV16-associated diseases. L2, a minor viral capsid protein, is able to induce
      a strong antibody response against certain HPV types.
